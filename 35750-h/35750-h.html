<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There are few subjects on which a greater number of
laborious volumes have been compiled, than the History and
Antiquities of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Rome</span></span>. Everything connected with its foreign
policy and civil constitution, or even with the domestic manners
of its citizens, has been profoundly and accurately investigated.
The mysterious origin of Rome, veiled in the wonders
of mythological fable—the stupendous increase of its power,
rendered yet more gigantic by the mists of antiquity—its undaunted
heroes, who seem to us like the genii of some greater
world—its wide dominion, extended over the whole civilized
globe—and, finally, its portentous fall, which forms, as it were,
the separation between ancient and modern times, have rendered
its civil and military history a subject of prevailing interest
to all enlightened nations. But, while its warlike exploits,
and the principles of its political institutions, have been repeatedly
and laboriously investigated, less attention, perhaps,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pageiv">[pg iv]</span><a name="Pgiv" id="Pgiv" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>has been paid to the history of its literature, than to that of any
other country, possessed of equal pretensions to learning and
refinement; and, in the English language at least, no connected
view of its Rise, its Progress, and Decline, has been as
yet presented to us. When the battles of Rome have been
accurately described, and all her political intrigues minutely
developed—when so much inquiry and thought have been bestowed,
not only on the wars, conquests, and civil institutions
of the Romans, but on their most trivial customs, it is wonderful
that so little has been done to exhibit the intellectual exertions
of the fancy and the reason, of their most refined and
exalted spirits.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It cannot, indeed, be denied, that the civil history of Rome,
and her military operations, present our species in a lofty aspect
of power, magnanimity, and courage—that they exhibit
the widest range and utmost extent of the human powers in
enterprize and resources—and that statesmen or philosophers
may derive from them topics to illustrate almost every political
speculation. Yet, however vast and instructive may be the
page which unfolds the eventful history of the foreign hostilities
and internal commotions of the Roman people, it can hardly
be more interesting than the analogies between their literary
attainments and the other circumstances of their condition;—the
peculiarities of their literature, its peculiar origination, and
the peculiar effects which it produced. The literature of a
people may indeed, in one sense, be regarded as the most attractive
feature of its history. It is at once the effect of
leisure and refinement, and the means of increasing and perpetuating
the civilization from which it springs. Literature, as a
late writer has powerfully and eloquently demonstrated, pos<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagev">[pg v]</span><a name="Pgv" id="Pgv" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>sesses
an extensive moral agency, and a close connection with
    glory, liberty, and happiness<a id="noteref_1" name="noteref_1" href="#note_1"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1</span></span></a>; and hence the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">history</span></span> of literature
becomes associated with all that concerns the fame, the
freedom, and the felicity of nations. <span class="tei tei-q">“There is no part of history,”</span>
says Dr Johnson, <span class="tei tei-q">“so generally useful, as that which
relates the progress of the human mind—the gradual improvement
of reason—the successive advances of science—the vicissitudes
of learning and ignorance, which are the light and darkness
of thinking beings—the extinction and resuscitation of
arts, and the revolutions of the intellectual world. If accounts
of battles and invasions are peculiarly the business of princes,
    the useful or elegant arts are not to be neglected<a id="noteref_2" name="noteref_2" href="#note_2"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2</span></span></a>.”</span> If, then,
in the literary history of Rome, we do not meet with those dazzling
events, and stupendous results, which, from their lustre
and magnitude, still seem, as it were, placed at the summit of
human affairs, we shall find in it more intelligence and order,
in consequence of its progress being less dependent on passion
and interest. The trophies, too, of the most absolute power,
and the most unlimited empire, seem destined, as if by a moral
necessity, to pass away: But the dominion which the writers of
Rome exercise over the human mind, will last as long as the
world, or at least as long as its civilization—

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There are chiefly two points of view, in which literary history
may be regarded as of high utility and importance. The
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagevi">[pg vi]</span><a name="Pgvi" id="Pgvi" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">first</span></span> is the consideration of the powerful effect of literature on
the manners and habits of the people among whom it flourishes.
It is noble, indeed, in itself, and its productions are glorious,
without any relative considerations. An ingenious literary
performance has <a name="corrvi" id="corrvi" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">its</span> intrinsic merits, and would delight an enthusiastic
scholar, or contemplative philosopher, in perfect
solitude, even though he himself were the only reader, and the
work the production of a Being of a different order from himself.
But what renders literature chiefly interesting, is the
influence which it exercises on the dignity and happiness of
human nature, by improving the character, and enlarging the
capacity, of our species. A stream, however grand or beautiful
in itself, derives its chief interest from a consideration of its
influence on the landscape it adorns; and, in this point of view,
literature has been well likened to <span class="tei tei-q">“a noble lake or majestic
river, which imposes on the imagination by every impression
of dignity and sublimity. But it is the moisture that insensibly
arises from them, which, gradually mingling with the soil,
nourishes all the luxuriance of vegetation, and fructifies and
    adorns the surface of the earth<a id="noteref_4" name="noteref_4" href="#note_4"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">4</span></span></a>.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Literature, however, has not in all ages denoted, with equal
accuracy, the condition of mankind, or been equally efficacious
in impelling their progress, and contributing to their improvement.
In the ancient empires of the East, where monarchies
were despotic, and priests the only scholars, learning was regarded
by those who were possessed of it rather as a means of
confirming an ascendancy over the vulgar, than of improving
their condition; and they were more desirous to perpetuate the
subjection, than contribute to the melioration of mankind. Ac<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagevii">[pg vii]</span><a name="Pgvii" id="Pgvii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>cordingly,
almost every trace of this confined and perverted
learning has vanished from the world. In the freer states of
antiquity, as the republics of Greece and Rome, letters found
various outlets, by which their improving influence was imparted,
more or less extensively, to the bulk of the citizens.
Dramatic representations were among the most favourite
amusements, and oratorical displays excited among all classes
the most lively interest. Such public exhibitions established
points of contact, from which light was elicited. The mind
of the multitude was enriched by the contemplation of superior
intellect, and mankind were, to a certain extent, united by the
reception of similar impressions, and the excitement of similar
emotions.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Still, however, the history of any part of ancient literature
is, in respect of its influence on the condition of states, far less
important than that of modern nations. From the high price
and scarcity of books, a restriction was imposed on the diffusion
of knowledge. <span class="tei tei-q">“A bulwark existed between the body of
mankind and the reflecting few. They were distinct nations
inhabiting the same country; and the opinions of the one,
speaking comparatively with modern times, had little influence
    on the other<a id="noteref_5" name="noteref_5" href="#note_5"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">5</span></span></a>.”</span> The learned, in those days, wrote only or
chiefly for the learned and the great. They neither expected
nor cultivated the approbation of the mass of mankind. An extensive
and noisy celebrity was interdicted. It was only with the
more estimable part of his species that the author was united

approbation of judges so skilful, or expect an immortality so
difficult to be preserved. While this may, perhaps, have contributed
to the polish and perfection of literary works, it is
obvious that the general influence of letters must have been
less humanizing, and must have had less tendency to unite and
assimilate mankind. Even philosophers, whose peculiar business
was the instruction of their species, had no mode of disseminating
or perpetuating their opinions, except by the formation
of sects and schools, which created for the masters,
pupils who were the followers of his creed, and the depositaries
of his claims to immortality.

It is this, and not the height to which individual genius has
soared, that forms the grand distinction between ancient and
modern literature. The triumph of modern literature consists
not in the point of elevation to which it has attained, but in the
extent of its conquests—the extent to which it has refined and
quickened the mass of mankind. It would be difficult to adjust
the intellectual precedence of Newton and Archimedes—of
Bacon and Aristotle—of Shakspeare and Homer—of Thucydides
and Hume: But it may be declared with certainty, that
the people of modern nations, in consequence of literature be<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pageix">[pg ix]</span><a name="Pgix" id="Pgix" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>ing more widely diffused, have become more civilized and enlightened.

With regard to the Romans, in particular, they are allowed
to have been a civilized nation, powerfully constituted, and
wisely governed, previous to the existence of any author in the
Latin language. Their character was formed before their literature
was created: their moral and patriotic dignity, indeed,
had reached its highest perfection, in the age in which their
literature commenced—the age of Lælius and Africanus. Except
in the province of the drama, it always continued a patrician
attribute; and though intellectual improvement could not
have facilitated the inroads of vice and guilty ambition, it certainly
proved inadequate to stem the tide of moral corruption,
to mitigate the sanguinary animosities of faction, or to retard
the establishment of despotism.

Literary history is, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">secondly</span></span>, of importance, as being the index
of the character and condition of a people—as holding up
a mirror, which reflects the manners and customs of remote or
ancient nations. The less influence, however, which literature
exercises, the less valuable will be its picture of life and manners.
It must also be admitted, that from a separate cause, the early
periods, at least, of Roman literature, possess not in this point
of view any peculiar attractions. When literature is indigenous,
as it was in Greece, where authors were guided by no antecedent
system, and their compositions were shaped on no
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagex">[pg x]</span><a name="Pgx" id="Pgx" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>other model than the objects themselves which they were occupied
in delineating, or the living passions they portrayed, an
accurate estimate of the general state of manners and feeling
may be drawn from works written at various epochs of the national
history. But, at Rome, the pursuit of literature was
neither a native nor predominant taste among the people. The
Roman territory was always a foreign soil for letters, which
were not the produce of national genius, but were naturalized
by the assiduous culture of a few individuals reared in the
schools of Greece. Indeed, the early Roman authors, particularly
the dramatic, who, of all others, best illustrate the prevalent
ideas and sentiments of a nation, were mere translators
from the Greek. Hence, those delineations, which at first
view might appear to be characteristic national sketches, are
in fact the draught of foreign manners, and the mirror of customs
which no Roman adopted, or of sentiments in which, perhaps,
no Roman participated.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Since, then, the literature of Rome exercised but a limited
influence on the conduct of its citizens, and as it reciprocally
reflects but a partial light on their manners and institutions, its
history must, in a great measure, consist of biographical
sketches of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">authors</span></span>—of critical accounts of their <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">works</span></span>—and
an examination of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">influence</span></span> which these works have exercised
on modern literature. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">authors</span></span> of Rome were, in
their characters, and the events of their lives, more interesting
than the writers of any ancient or modern land. The authors
who flourished during the existence of the Roman Republic,
were Cato the Censor, Cicero, and Cæsar; men who (independently
of their literary claims to celebrity) were unrivalled in
their own age and country, and have scarcely been surpassed
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexi">[pg xi]</span><a name="Pgxi" id="Pgxi" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>in any other. I need not here anticipate those observations
which the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">works</span></span> of the Roman authors will suggest in the following
pages. Though formed on a model which has been
shaped by the Greeks, we shall perceive through that spirit of
imitation which marks all their literary productions, a tone of
practical utility, derived from the familiar acquaintance which
their writers exercised with the business and affairs of life; and
also that air of nationality, which was acquired from the greatness
and unity of the Roman republic, and could not be expected
in literary works, produced where there was a subdivision
of states in the same country, as in Greece, modern Italy,
Germany, and Britain. We shall remark a characteristic
authority of expression, a gravity, circumspection, solidity of
understanding, and dignity of sentiment, produced partly by
the moral firmness that distinguished the character of the Romans,
their austerity of manners, and tranquillity of temper, but
chiefly by their national pride, and the exalted name of Roman
citizen, which their authors bore. And, finally, we shall recognise
that love of rural retirement which originated in the
mode of life of the ancient Italians, and was augmented by the
pleasing contrast which the undisturbed repose and simple enjoyments
of rural existence presented to the bustle of an immense
and agitated capital. In the last point of view that has
been alluded to—the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">influence</span></span> which these works have exercised
on modern letters—it cannot be denied that the literary
history of Rome is peculiarly interesting. If the Greeks gave
the first impulse to literature, the Romans engraved the traces of
its progress deeper on the world. <span class="tei tei-q">“The earliest writers,”</span> as has
been justly remarked, <span class="tei tei-q">“took possession of the most striking objects
for description, and the most probable occurrences for
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexii">[pg xii]</span><a name="Pgxii" id="Pgxii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>fiction, and left nothing to those that followed, but transcriptions
of the same events, and new combinations of the same
    images<a id="noteref_6" name="noteref_6" href="#note_6"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">6</span></span></a>.”</span> The great author from whom these reflections are
quoted, had at one time actually <span class="tei tei-q">“projected a work, to show
how small a quantity of invention there is in the world, and that
the same images and incidents, with little variation, have served
    all the authors who have ever written<a id="noteref_7" name="noteref_7" href="#note_7"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">7</span></span></a>.”</span> Had he prosecuted
his intention, he would have found the notion he entertained
fully confirmed by the history both of dramatic and
romantic fiction; he would have perceived the incapacity of
the most active and fertile imagination greatly to diversify the
common characters and incidents of life, which, on a superficial
view, one might suppose to be susceptible of infinite combinations; 
he would have found, that while Plautus and Terence
servilely copied from the Greek dramatists, even Ariosto
scarcely diverged in his comedies from the paths of Plautus.

There are three great ages in the literary history of Rome—that
which precedes the æra of Augustus—the epoch which is

commenced immediately after his death, and may be considered
as extending to the destruction of Rome. Of these periods,
the first and second run into each other with respect to dates,
but the difference in their spirit and taste may be easily distinguished. 
Although Cicero died during the triumvirate of Octavius, 
his genius breathes only the spirit of the Republic; and
though Virgil and Horace were born during the subsistence of

influence.

In tracing the Literary History of a people, it is important
not only to ascertain whence their first rudiments of knowledge
were derived, but even to fix the origin of those tribes,
whose cultivation, being superior to their own, acted as an
incentive to literary exertion. The privilege, however, assumed
by national vanity, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">miscendi humana divinis</span></span>, has
enveloped the antiquities of almost every country in darkness
and mystery: But there is no race whose early history is
involved in greater obscurity and contradiction than the first
inhabitants of those Italian states, which finally formed component
parts of the Roman republic. The origin of the five
Saturnian, and twelve Etruscan cities, is lost in the mist of
ages; and we may as well hope to obtain credible information
concerning the monuments of Egypt or India, as to investigate
their inscrutable antiquities. At the period when light
is first thrown, by authentic documents, on the condition of
Italy, we find it occupied by various tribes, which had reached
different degrees of civilization, which spoke different dialects,
and disputed with each other the property of the lands whence
they drew their subsistence. All before that time is founded
on poetical embellishment, the speculations of theorists, or
national vanity arrogating to itself a Trojan, a Grecian, or
even a divine original.

ancient world. It is probable, that a country gifted like this
peninsula, with a fertile soil, incomparable climate, and unusual
charms of scenery, attracted the attention of its neighbours,
and sometimes allured them from less favoured settlements.

The customs, and even names, which were prevalent in Egypt,
Phœnicia, and Greece, were thus introduced into Italy, and
formed materials from which the framers of systems have constructed
theories concerning its first colonization by the Egyptians,
the Pelasgi, or whatever nation they chose. There is
scarcely, however, an ancient history or document entitled to
credit, and recording the arrival of a colony in Italy, which
does not also mention that the new-comers found prior tribes,
with whom they waged war, or intermixed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The ample lakes and lofty mountains, by which Italy is
intersected, naturally divided its inhabitants into separate and
independent nations. Of these by far the most celebrated
were the Etruscans. The origin of this remarkable people,
called Tyrrhenians by the Greeks, and Thusci, or Etrusci, by
the Latins, has been a subject of endless controversy among
antiquarians; and, indeed, had perplexed the ancients no less
than it has puzzled the moderns. Herodotus, the earliest authentic
historian whose works are now extant, represents them
as a colony of Lydians, who were themselves a tribe of the
vagrant Pelasgi. In the reign of Atys, son of Menes, the Lydian
nation being driven to extremity by famine, the king
divided it into two portions, one of which was destined to
remain in Asia, and the other to emigrate under the conduct
of his son Tyrrhenus. The inhabitants who composed the
latter division leaving their country, repaired to Smyrna, where
they built vessels, and removed in search of new abodes. After
touching on various shores, they penetrated into the heart of
Italy, and at length settled in Umbria. There they constructed
dwellings, and called themselves Tyrrhenians, from the
    name of their leader<a id="noteref_10" name="noteref_10" href="#note_10"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">10</span></span></a>. Some of the circumstances which Herodotus
relates as having occurred previous to the emigration
of the Lydian colony appear fabulous, as the invention of
games, in order to appease the sensation of hunger, and the
fasting every alternate day for a space of eighteen years;
and it would, perhaps, be too much to assert, that before
the Lydians, no other tribe had ever set foot in Umbria or
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page21">[pg 21]</span><a name="Pg021" id="Pg021" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Etruria. But the account of the departure of the colony
is itself plausible, and its truth appears to be corroborated, if
not confirmed, by certain resemblances in the language, religion,
    and pastimes of the Lydians, and of the ancient Etruscans<a id="noteref_11" name="noteref_11" href="#note_11"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">11</span></span></a>.
The manners, too, and customs of the Lydians, did
not differ essentially from those of the Greeks; and the princes
of Lydia, like the sovereigns of Persia, being accustomed
to employ Phœnician or Egyptian sailors, the colony of Lydians,
which settled in Italy, might thus contain a mixture
of such people, and present those appearances which have led
some antiquarians to consider the Etruscans as Phœnicians or
Egyptians, while others have regarded them as Greeks. The
writers of antiquity, though varying in particulars, have followed,
in general, the tradition delivered by Herodotus concerning
    the descent of the Etruscans. Cicero, Strabo<a id="noteref_12" name="noteref_12" href="#note_12"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">12</span></span></a>, Velleius
    Paterculus<a id="noteref_13" name="noteref_13" href="#note_13"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">13</span></span></a>, Seneca, Pliny, Plutarch<a id="noteref_14" name="noteref_14" href="#note_14"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">14</span></span></a>, and Servius, all
affirm that they came from Lydia; and to these may be added
Catullus, who calls the lake Benacus <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lydiæ lacus undæ</span></span>, obviously
because he considered the <a name="corr021" id="corr021" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">ancient</span> Etruscans, within
whose extended territory it lay, as of Lydian origin. It is
evident, too, that the Etruscans themselves believed that they
had sprung from the Lydians, and that they inculcated this
belief on others. Tacitus informs us, that, in the reign of
Tiberius, a contest concerning their respective antiquity arose
among eleven cities of Asia, which were heard by their deputies
in presence of the Emperor. The Sardians rested their
claims on an alleged affinity to the Etruscans, and, in support
of their pretensions, produced an ancient decree, in which that
people declared themselves descended from the followers of
Tyrrhenus, who had left their native country of Lydia, and
    founded new settlements in Italy<a id="noteref_15" name="noteref_15" href="#note_15"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">15</span></span></a>.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Hellanicus of Lesbos, a Greek historian, nearly contemporary
with Herodotus, and quoted by Dionysius of Halicarnassus,
asserted that the Etruscans were a tribe of Pelasgi, not from
Lydia, but from Greece, who being driven out of their country
by the Hellenes, sailed to the mouth of the Po, and leaving
their ships in that river, built the inland town of Cortona,
whence advancing, they peopled the whole territory afterwards
    called Tyrrhenia<a id="noteref_16" name="noteref_16" href="#note_16"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">16</span></span></a>.

Dionysius of Halicarnassus holds the account of those authors,
who maintain that the Etruscans were descended from
the Lydians, to be utterly fabulous, principally on the ground
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page22">[pg 22]</span><a name="Pg022" id="Pg022" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>that Xantus, the chief historian of Lydia, says nothing of any
colony having emigrated thence to Italy; and he is of opinion,
that those also are mistaken, who, like Hellanicus of Lesbos,
believed the Etruscans and Pelasgi to be the same people.
He conceives them to have been Aborigines, or natives of the
country, as they radically agreed with no other nation, either
in their language or manner of life. He admits, however, that
a tribe of Pelasgi passed from Thessaly to the mouth of the
Po many ages previous to the Trojan war, and directing their
course to the south, occupied a considerable portion of the
heart of Italy. Soon after their arrival, they assisted the aboriginal
Etruscans in their wars with the Siculi, whom they
forced to seek refuge in Sicily, the seat of the ancient Sicani.
Subsequent to this alliance, they were again dispersed in
consequence of disease and famine; but a few still remained
behind, and being incorporated with the original inhabitants,
bestowed on them whatever in language or customs appeared
to be common to the Etruscans, with other nations of Pelasgic
    descent<a id="noteref_17" name="noteref_17" href="#note_17"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">17</span></span></a>.

Several eminent writers among the moderns have partly
coincided with Dionysius. Dempster seems to think that
there was an indigenous population in Etruria, but that it was
increased both by the Lydian emigration and by colonies of
    Pelasgi from Greece<a id="noteref_18" name="noteref_18" href="#note_18"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">18</span></span></a>. Bochart is nearly of the same opinion; 
only he farther admits of a direct intercourse between
the Etruscans and Phœnicians, whence the former may have
received many Oriental fables and customs. He denies, however,
that there was any resemblance in the languages of
these two people; and the Etruscan arts he believes to have
    been chiefly derived from Greece<a id="noteref_19" name="noteref_19" href="#note_19"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">19</span></span></a>. The opinion of Bochart
on these latter points is so much the more entitled to weight,
as his prepossessions would have led him to maintain an opposite
system could it have been plausibly supported. Gibbon
also declares in favour of Dionysius; and, as to the relation
of Herodotus, he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“L’opinion d’Herodote, qui les

Several recent Italian writers likewise have maintained, that,
previous to the arrival of any Lydian or Pelasgic colony, there
existed what they term an indigenous population, by which
they do not merely signify a population whose origin cannot

Gorius derives every thing Etruscan from Egypt or Phœnicia.
These countries he considers as the original seats of the Pelasgi,
who, being driven out of them, settled in Achaia, Thrace,
Arcadia, and Lydia, and from these regions gradually, and at
    different times, passed into Italy<a id="noteref_22" name="noteref_22" href="#note_22"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">22</span></span></a>.

A similar system has been adopted by Lord Monboddo.—From
a resemblance in their letters and language to those of
the Greeks, he believes the Etruscans to have been a very ancient
colony of the roaming Pelasgi who left Arcadia in quest
of new settlements. These Pelasgi, however, he maintains,
were not themselves indigenous in Arcadia, as they issued
originally from Egypt, where there was a district and a city
    of the name of Arcadia<a id="noteref_23" name="noteref_23" href="#note_23"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">23</span></span></a>.

Mazzochi follows the oriental theory, but does not venture
to determine from what eastern region the Etruscans emigrated.
He merely affirms, that they spread from the east, under which
term he includes regions very remote from each other—Assyria,
    Armenia, Canaan, and Egypt<a id="noteref_24" name="noteref_24" href="#note_24"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">24</span></span></a>. He also thinks that they
came directly from the east, without having previously passed
through Lydia or Arcadia: For, if they had, the monuments
of these latter countries would exhibit (which they do not)
still stronger remains of oriental antiquity than those of the
Etruscans. This descent Mazzochi attempts to confirm by
the most fanciful derivations of words and proper names of
the Etruscan nation from the eastern languages, especially
from the Hebrew and Syriac. Thus one of the most extensive
plains in Italy, and the spot where, in all probability, the
oriental colony first landed, is near the æstuary of the Po.
This plain they naturally called Paddan, one of the names of
the level Mesopotamia, and the appellation of the district soon
came to be transferred to the river Padus or Po, by which it
was bounded. It occurred to the author, however, that the
Eridanus was the more ancient name of the Po; but this only
furnishes him with a new argument. Eraz, it seems, signifies
in Hebrew, a cedar, or any sort of resinous tree, and the orientals,
finding a number of trees of this nature on the banks
of the Po, and Z being a convertible letter with D, they could
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page24">[pg 24]</span><a name="Pg024" id="Pg024" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>not fail to call the river, near which they grew in such abundance,

Maffei brings them directly from Canaan, and supposes
them to have been the race expelled from that region by the
Moabites, or children of Lot. The river Arnon, (whence
Arno,) flowed not far from that part of Canaan, where Lot
and Abram first sojourned; one of its districts was called
Etroth, (whence Etruria); and on the banks of the Arnon
stood the city Ar, a syllable which is a frequent compound in
Etruscan appellatives. The Etruscans erected their places of
worship on hills or high places—they formed corporeal images
of their divine beings like the idolatrous race from

By far the most voluminous, but at the same time one of
the most fanciful writers concerning the Etruscans, is Guarnacci,
who maintains, that they came directly from the east,
and were stragglers who had been dispersed by Noah’s flood,

and Aborigines, according to him, were the same people, under
a different denomination, as the Etruscans: They gradually
spread themselves over all Italy, and some tribes of them,
called, from their wandering habits, Pelasgi, at length emigrated
to Greece and Lydia; so that, whatever similarity has
been traced in the language, religion, manners, or arts, of the
Greeks and Etruscans, is the consequence of the Etruscan
colonization of Greece, and not, as is generally supposed, of
Italy having been peopled by Pelasgic colonies from Arcadia

In general, the oriental system has been maintained in opposition
to all other theories, chiefly on the ground that the

The oriental theory, in all its modifications, has been strenuously
opposed by a number of learned Italian, French, and
German antiquaries, who have contended for the northern
and Celtic origin of the Etruscans, and have ridiculed the
opinions of their predecessors as if they themselves were
about to promulgate a more rational system. Bardetti, while
he admits a colonization of Italy from foreign quarters, prior
even to the Trojan war, maintains, that it was inhabited by a
primitive population long before the landing of the Lydians
or Pelasgi: That previous to the arrival of the latter tribe at
the mouth of the Po, which happened 300 years before the
siege of Troy, there had been no navigation to Italy from
Egypt, or any other country: That, therefore, this primitive
population must have come by land, and could have been no
other than bands of Celts who were the immediate posterity
of Japheth, and who, having originally settled in Gaul, descended
to Italy from the Alps by Rhetium, Tirol, and Trent.
Their first seats were the regions along the banks of the Po;
the earliest tribes of their population were called Ligurians
and Umbrians, and from them sprung the Etrurians, and all
    the other ancient nations of Italy<a id="noteref_29" name="noteref_29" href="#note_29"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">29</span></span></a>.

The most learned and correct writer on the subject of the
    Etruscans is Lanzi. In his elaborate work<a id="noteref_36" name="noteref_36" href="#note_36"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">36</span></span></a>, (in which he has
followed out and improved on a system first started by Ulivieri,)
he does not pretend to investigate the origin of this celebrated
race, though he seems to think that they were Lydians,
augmented from time to time by tribes of the Pelasgi. But
he has tried to prove that whatever may have been their descent,
the religion, learning, language, and arts of the Etruscans
must be referred to a Greek origin, and he refutes Gori
and Caylus, who, deceived by a few imperfect analogies, ascribed
them to the Egyptians. The period of Etruscan perfection
in the arts, and formation of those vases and urns
which we still admire, was posterior, he maintains, to the
subjugation of Etruria by the Romans, and at a time when an
intercourse with Greece had rendered the Etruscans familiar
with models of Grecian perfection. As to the language, he
does not indeed deny that all languages came originally from
the east, and that many Greek words sprung from Hebrew
roots; but there are in the Etruscan tongue, he asserts, such
clear traces of Hellenism, particularly in the names of gods
and heroes, that it is impossible to ascribe its origin to any
other source. In particular, he attempts to show from the inscriptions
on the Eugubian tables, that the Etruscan language
was the Æolic Greek, since it has neither the monosyllables
characteristic of northern tongues, nor the affixes and suffixes
    peculiar to oriental dialects<a id="noteref_37" name="noteref_37" href="#note_37"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">37</span></span></a>.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From whatever nation originally sprung, the Etruscans at
an early period attained an enviable height of prosperity and
power. Etruria Proper, or the most ancient Etruria, reached
from the Arno to the Tiber, being nearly bounded all along
by these rivers, from their sources to their junction with the
Tyrrhenian sea. Soon, however, the Etruscans passed those
narrow limits;—to the north, they spread their conquests over
the Ligurians, who inhabited the region beyond the Arno,
and to this territory the conquerors gave the name of New
Etruria. To the south, they crossed the Tiber, made allies
or tributaries of the Latins, and introduced among them many
of their usages and rites. Having thus opened a way through
Latium, they drove the Osci from the fertile plains of Cam<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page27">[pg 27]</span><a name="Pg027" id="Pg027" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>pania, and founded the city of Capua, about fifty years before
the building of Rome. Colonies, too, were sent out by them
to spots beyond their immediate sway, till at length the Italian
name was nearly sunk in that of the Etruscans. Their
minds, however, were not wholly bent on conquest and political
<a name="corr027" id="corr027" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">aggrandizement</span>; their attention was also directed to useful
institutions, and to the cultivation of the fine arts. The
twelve confederated cities of Etruria were embellished with
numberless monuments of architecture; wholesome laws were
enacted, commerce was extended along all the shores of the
Mediterranean: and, in short, by their means the general progress
of civilization in Italy was prodigiously accelerated.
The glory and prosperity of the Etruscans were at their
height before Rome yet possessed a name. But their government,
like that of all other republics, contained the seeds of
decay. Each state had the choice of remaining as a commonwealth,
or electing a king; but the Kings, or Lucumons, as
they were usually called, were only the priests and presidents
of the different cities of the confederation. There was no
monarch of the whole realm; and it is the series of these Lucumons
that has swelled the confused list of kings presented
by Etruscan antiquaries. Each state had also the privilege
of separately declaring war or concluding peace; and each
appears, on all occasions, to have been more anxious for its
own safety, than for the general interests of the union. Hence,
rivalships and dissensions prevailed in the general assemblies
of the twelve states. A confederate government, thus united
by a link of political connection, almost as feeble as the Amphictyonic
council of Greece, afforded no such compact resistance
as could oppose an adequate barrier to the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">unica vis</span></span>
of the intrepid enemies with whom the Etruscans had now to
contend. At sea they were assailed by the Syracusans and
Carthaginians; the Umbrians retook several of their ancient
possessions; they were forced to yield the plains which lie
between the Alps and Apennines to the valour of the Gauls;
and the Samnites expelled them from the yet more desirable
and delicious regions of Campania.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
While the Etruscans were thus again confined almost within
the territory which still bears their name, and extends from
the Tiber northward to the Apennines, a yet more formidable
foe than any they had hitherto encountered appeared on the
political theatre of Italy. It was Latium, which had the singular
fortune to see one of its towns rise to the supreme dominion
of Italy, and finally of the world. This city, which
Dionysius of Halicarnassus represents as a respectable colony,
fitted out from Alba under the escort of Romulus, and thence
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page28">[pg 28]</span><a name="Pg028" id="Pg028" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>supplied with money, provisions, and arms; but which was
more probably composed of outlaws from the Equi, Marsi,
Volsci, and other Latian tribes, had gradually acquired
strength, while the power of the Etruscans had decayed. Enervated
    by opulence and luxury<a id="noteref_38" name="noteref_38" href="#note_38"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">38</span></span></a>, they were led to despise
the rough unpolished manners of the Romans; but during
centuries of almost incessant warfare, they were daily taught
to dread their military skill and prowess. The fall of Veii
was a tremendous warning, and they now sought to preserve
their independence rather by stratagem than force of arms.
At length, in an evil hour, they availed themselves of the difficulties
of their enemy; and, while the rival republic was
pressed on the south by the Samnites, they leagued with those
northern hordes which descended from the Alps to the anticipated
conquest of Rome. Before they had fully united with
the Gauls, the Consul Dolabella annihilated, near the Lake
Vadimona, the military population of Etruria, and the feeble
remains of the nation received the imperious conditions of
peace, dictated by the victors, which left them nothing but
the shadow of a great name,—the glory of attending the Roman
march to the conquest of the world, and the vestiges of
arts destined to attract the curiosity and research of the latest
posterity.

The vicinity of the <a name="corr028" id="corr028" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">Etruscans</span> to Rome, from which their
territories were separated only by the Tiber,—the alliance of
their leader, Cœlius, with Romulus, and the habitation assigned
them on the Cœlian Mount,—the accession to the Roman
sovereignty of the elder Tarquin, who was descended
from a Greek family which had fixed its residence in Etruria,—the
settlement of a number of Etruscan prisoners, four years
after the expulsion of the kings, in a street called the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vicus
Tuscus</span></span>, in the very heart of the city;—and, finally, the intercourse
produced by the long period of warfare and political
intrigue which subsisted between the rising republic and
their more polished neighbours before they were incorporated
into one state, would be sufficient to account for the Roman
reception of the customs and superstitions of Etruria, as also
for the interchange of literary materials. It does not seem
that the hostility of rival nations prevents the reciprocal adoption
of manners and literature. The romantic gallantry and
learning of the Arabs in the south of Spain soon passed the
limits of their splendid empire; and long before the conquest
of Wales the Cambrian fables and traditions concerning
Arthur and his host of heroes were domesticated in the court
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page29">[pg 29]</span><a name="Pg029" id="Pg029" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of England. Accordingly, we find that the Romans were
indebted to the Etruscans for the form of the robes which
invested their magistrates, the pomp that attended their
triumphs, and even the music that animated their legions. The
purple vest, the sceptre surmounted by an eagle, the curule
chair, the fasces and lictors, were the ensigns and accompaniments
of supreme authority among the Etruscans; while the
triumphs and ovations, the combats of gladiators and Circensian
games, were common to them and the Romans.

Dionysius of Halicarnassus particularly points out the difference
between the religion of the Greeks and the Romans.
The latter, he informs us, <span class="tei tei-q">“did not admit into their creed those
impious stories told by the Greeks of the castration of their
gods, or of destroying their own children, of their wars, wounds,
bonds, and slavery, and such like things as are not only altogether
unworthy of the divine nature, but disgrace even the human.
They had no wailing and lamentations for the sufferings
of their gods, nor like the Greeks, any Bacchic orgies, or vigils
of men and women together in the temples. And if at any
time they admitted such foreign pollutions, as they did with
regard to the rites of Cybele and the Idæan goddess, the ceremonies
were performed under the grave inspection of Roman
magistrates; nor even now does any Roman disguise himself
    to act the mummeries performed by the priests of Cybele<a id="noteref_46" name="noteref_46" href="#note_46"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">46</span></span></a>”</span>.
Dionysius, who refers every thing to Greece, thinks that the
early Roman was just the Greek religion purified by Romulus,
to whom, in fact, his country was more indebted than to Numa
for its sacred institutions. In reality, however, this superior
purity of rites and worship was not occasioned by any such
lustration of the Greek fables, but from their being founded
on Italian, and not on Grecian superstitions.

pure, and its rites more useful, than those of Greece, its fables
were not so ingenious and alluring. Ora, the goddess of
health and youth, was less elegant than Hebe; and even the
genius of Virgil, who has chosen the Italian <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Myths</span></span> for the
machinery of the Æneid, could hardly bestow grace or dignity
on the prodigy of the swarm of bees that hung in clusters
from the Laurentian Laurel—on the story of the robber Cacus
vomiting flames, the ships metamorphosed into nymphs, the
sow which farrowed thirty white pigs, and thereby announced
that the town of Alba would be built in thirty years, the puerile
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page31">[pg 31]</span><a name="Pg031" id="Pg031" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>fiction of the infancy of Camilla, or the hideous harpy which
hovered round the head of Turnus, and portended his death.
Accordingly, when the Romans were allured by the arts of
Greece, the rude and simple traditions of Italian mythology
yielded to the enticing and voluptuous fictions of a more polished
    people<a id="noteref_47" name="noteref_47" href="#note_47"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">47</span></span></a>. The tolerant spirit of Polytheism did not
restrict the number of gods, and the ministers of superstition
seemed always ready to reconcile the most discordant systems.
Hence the poet interwove the national traditions with
the Greek fables, and concentrated in one the attributes of
different divinities. Thus, the Greek Kronos was identified
with Saturn; the rustic deities, Sylvanus and Faunus, peculiar
to Latium, being confounded with Pan, the Satyrs, and Silenus,
were associated with the train of Bacchus; Portumnus
was converted into Palemon—a deity whom the Greeks had
received from Phœnicia; Bona Dea was transformed to Hecate,
and Libitina to Proserpine; and the Camesnæ, or Camenæ, of
the family of Janus, who prophesied in Saturnian verse on the
summit of Mount Janiculum, were metamorphosed into
    Muses<a id="noteref_48" name="noteref_48" href="#note_48"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">48</span></span></a>. Hercules, Jupiter, and Venus, gods of power and
pleasure, occupied, with their splendid temples, the place of
the peaceful and pastoral deities of Numa. Still, however,
the national religion was in some measure retained, and Apollo
and Bacchus, in particular, continued to be decorated with
the characteristic emblems of Etruria.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Etruscans do not seem to have believed, like the Greeks,
that they were possessed of those interpretations of passing
events or revelations of futurity which were obtained by immediate
inspiration, whether delivered from the hill of Dodona,
or the Delphian shrine. Their divination was supposed to be
the result of experience and observation; and though not destitute
of divine direction or concurrence, depended chiefly on
human contrivance. Among them peculiar families, like the
tribe of Levi, the Peruvian Incas, and the descendants of Thor
and Odin, were depositaries of the secrets and ceremonies of
religion. Their prognostics were taken from the flight of
    birds<a id="noteref_49" name="noteref_49" href="#note_49"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">49</span></span></a>, the entrails of animals, and observations on thunder.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page32">[pg 32]</span><a name="Pg032" id="Pg032" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>In the early ages of Rome, a band of Patrician youths was
sent to Etruria, to be initiated in the mysteries of its religious
    rites<a id="noteref_50" name="noteref_50" href="#note_50"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">50</span></span></a>. The constant practice of consulting the gods on all
enterprizes, public or private,—the belief, that prodigies manifested
the will of heaven, and that the deities could be
appeased, and their vengeance averted by expiations or sacrifices,
were common to the Tuscan and Roman creeds. In
short, the fervent spirit of Etrurian superstition passed undiminished
to the Romans, who owed to its influence much of
their valour, temperance, and patriotism. To this, Cicero in
a great degree ascribes their political supremacy. The Romans,
says he, were not superior in numbers to the Spaniards,
in strength or courage to the Gauls, in address to the Carthaginians,
in tactics to the Macedonians; but we surpass all nations
in that prime wisdom by which we have learned that all
things are governed and directed by the immortal gods.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To the same singular people from whom they derived their
customs and superstitions, the Romans were much indebted
for their majestic language. As their writers in a great measure
owe their immortality to the lofty tones and commanding
accents of the Latin tongue, it would be improper entirely to
neglect its origin in entering on the literary history of Rome.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The supporters of the various systems with regard to the first
peopling of Etruria, of course discover the elements of the
Etruscan language in that of the different nations by whom
they believe it to have been colonized. Lord Monboddo, for
example, deduces both the Latin and Etruscan from the old
Pelasgic; which language, he asserts, was first brought into
Italy by a colony of Arcadians, seventeen generations before
the Trojan war. He considers the Latin as the most ancient
dialect of the Greek; and he remarks, that as it came off from
the original stock earlier than the Doric, or Æolic, or any other
Greek dialect now known, it has more of the roughness of the
primitive Hebrew, from which he believes the Pelasgic to be
    derived<a id="noteref_51" name="noteref_51" href="#note_51"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">51</span></span></a>. Lanzi also thinks that both the Latin and Etruscan
flowed from the Greek, and that the resemblance between the
Etruscan and Latin was not occasioned by the derivation of
the latter from the former, but was the necessary consequence
of both having sprung from a common source.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It certainly is not easy to discover the primary elements of
the Latin or any other language; but its immediate origin
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page33">[pg 33]</span><a name="Pg033" id="Pg033" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>may easily be traced. The inscriptions on the most ancient
monuments which have been discovered, from the Alps to
Calabria, shew that, from the time of the Etruscan supremacy,
there was an universal language in Italy, varied, indeed, by
dialects, but announcing a common origin in the inflections of
words and the forms of characters. The language of the
Etruscans had been so widely spread by their conquests, that
it might almost be regarded as the general tongue of Italy,
and the Latian, Oscan, and Sabine idioms, were in a great
measure the same with the Etruscan. From these the early
Latin language was chiefly formed; and what little Greek
existed in its original composition came through these languages
from the Pelasgic colonies, which in the remotest
periods had intermixed with the Etruscans, and with the
inhabitants of ancient Latium. <span class="tei tei-q">“It is a great mistake,”</span> says
Horne Tooke, <span class="tei tei-q">“into which the Latin etymologists have fallen,
to suppose that all the Latin must be found in the Greek, for
the fact is otherwise. The bulk and foundation of the Latin
language is Greek; but great part of the Latin is the language
of our northern ancestors grafted on the Greek; and to
our northern languages the etymologist must go for that part
    of the Latin which the Greek will not furnish<a id="noteref_52" name="noteref_52" href="#note_52"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">52</span></span></a>.”</span> This author
is correct, in affirming that all the Latin cannot be found in
the Greek; but he is far in error if he mean to maintain that
any part of the Latin came directly from the language of the
Celts, or that their uncouth jargon was grafted on the Greek.
The northern tongues, however, whether Celtic or Sclavonic,
may have contributed to form those dialects of Italy which
composed the original elements of the imperial language, and
were exhibited in great variety of combinations for five centuries
with little admixture of the Greek. The eminent grammarian
is still farther mistaken in declaring that the foundation
of the Latin language is Greek. That much of the Augustan
Latin is derived from the Greek, is true. Gataker, who
strenuously contends for the Greek origin of the whole Latin
language, has, as a specimen, attempted to shew, that every
word in the first five lines of Virgil’s Eclogues is drawn from
    the Greek<a id="noteref_53" name="noteref_53" href="#note_53"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">53</span></span></a>; and though part of his etymologies are fanciful,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page34">[pg 34]</span><a name="Pg034" id="Pg034" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>yet in a very considerable portion of them he has been completely
successful. But the case is totally different with the
ancient remnants of the Latin language previous to the capture
of Tarentum. In the song of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Fratres Arvales</span></span>, the oldest
specimen of the language extant, there seem to be only two
words which have any analogy to the Greek—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sal</span></span> from 
    <span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-family: Gentium, 'New Athena Unicode', 'DejaVu Serif', 'Lucida Grande', 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Palatino Linotype', serif">ἅλς</span></span>
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sta</span></span> from <span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-family: Gentium, 'New Athena Unicode', 'DejaVu Serif', 'Lucida Grande', 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Palatino Linotype', serif">ἱστημι</span></span>. That there was little Greek incorporated
with the Latin during the first ages of the Republic, is evident
from the circumstance, that the Latin inscriptions of a former
period were unintelligible to the historian Polybius, and the
most learned Romans of his age. Now, as he himself was a
Greek, and as the most learned Romans, by his time, had
become good Greek scholars, any Grecisms in the ancient inscriptions
would have been perfectly intelligible. It is evident,
therefore, that the difficulty arose from the words of the old
Italian dialects occurring instead of the new Greek terms,
suddenly introduced after the capture of Tarentum, and to
which the Romans having by that time become habituated,
could not understand the language of a preceding generation.
Besides, when Rome was originally filled with Latian
bands—when the Etruscans and Oscans were immediately
beyond the walls of Rome,—when, as early as the time of
Romulus, the Sabines were admitted within them,—when all
the women then in Rome were Sabines, (from which it may
be presumed that much of the conversation was carried on in
the Sabine dialect,) and, above all, when the Romans, for many
centuries, had little intercourse with any other people than
the Italian nations, it is not to be supposed that they would
borrow their colloquial language from the Celts, on the other
side of the Alps, or the Greeks, from whom they were separated
by the Adriatic Gulf, and who, as yet, had established
only remote, insignificant, and scattered colonies, in Italy.
Varro, too, has shewn the affinity between the Sabine and the
    Latin languages<a id="noteref_54" name="noteref_54" href="#note_54"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">54</span></span></a>. That the Oscan resembled the old Latin,
is proved from its being constantly employed in the most popular
dramatic representations at Rome, and from the circumstance
that almost every word of its few relics which
remain, is the root of some equivalent Latin term. Thus
Akeru produced acerra—Anter, inter—Phaisnam, fanum—Tesaur,
Thesaurus—Famel, famulus—Multa, mulcta—Solum,
(totus,) solus—Facul, Facultas—Cael, cœlum—Embratur,
    imperator.<a id="noteref_55" name="noteref_55" href="#note_55"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">55</span></span></a> The copious admixture of Greek only took place
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page35">[pg 35]</span><a name="Pg035" id="Pg035" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>after the taking of Tarentum, when the poets of Magna
Græcia settled at Rome, and were imitated by native writers,

So far, then, from the Latin language being composed of
Celtic grafted on the Greek, it appears to me to have been
formed from the Greek, grafted on those various dialects of
the Etruscan tongue, which prevailed in Italy at the period of
the building of Rome.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It would have been singular, when the Romans derived so
much from their Etruscan neighbours, if they had not also
acquired a portion of those arts which were the chief boast
of Etruria. Among the Etruscans, the arts certainly had not
the imposing character they assumed in Egypt, or the elegance
    they exhibited in Greece<a id="noteref_56" name="noteref_56" href="#note_56"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">56</span></span></a>; but in their vases, tombs,
and altars, which have recently been brought to light, we
possess abundant proofs of their taste and ingenuity. In
these—domestic occupations, marriages, spectacles, masquerades,
contests in the Circus, equestrian exercises, the chase,
triumphs, mysteries, funeral rites, Lares, Lamiæ, Lemures, and
deities of every description,—in short, all ancient Etruria
passes in review before the eye, which, in many instances,
must admire the boldness of the attitudes, the elegance of the
draperies, and justness of the proportions. The art of modelling,
or sculpture, appears to have been that in which the
Etruscans chiefly excelled. The statues of the first kings
erected at Rome, in the reign of the elder Tarquin, were of
their workmanship, as well as that of Horatius Cocles, and the
equestrian statue of Clelia. The Jupiter of the Capitol was
also Tuscan; and the four-wheeled chariot placed in his temple,
received its last polish from Etruscan hands, under the
first Roman consuls.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the course of the 5th century of Rome, not fewer than
2000 Etruscan statues, which were probably little figures in
bronze, were carried to that city from Volsinium, (now Bolsena,)
which the Romans were accused of having besieged, in
order to plunder it of these treasures. Architecture was unknown
in Rome until the Tarquins came from Etruria: hence
the works of the kings, some of which still remain, were
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page36">[pg 36]</span><a name="Pg036" id="Pg036" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>built in the Etruscan style, with large and regular, but uncemented
    blocks<a id="noteref_57" name="noteref_57" href="#note_57"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">57</span></span></a>. The most ancient and stupendous architectural
monuments of Rome, were executed by Etruscan
artists. Theirs were the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus, the
Circus, and Cloaca Maxima, which showed such a wonderful
    anticipation of the future magnitude of Rome<a id="noteref_58" name="noteref_58" href="#note_58"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">58</span></span></a>, and which
Livy pronounces equal to anything which had been produced
by modern magnificence. Painting, too, was introduced at
Rome from the Etruscans, about the middle of the fifth century,
by one of the Fabian family, who had long resided in
Etruria, and who himself painted in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">fresco</span></span>, after his return,
the interior of the Temple of Salus, and transmitted the sirname
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pictor</span></span> to his descendants.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The excellence to which the Etruscans had attained in
sculpture and architecture, forms a presumption of their proficiency
in those sciences which are essential to eminence in
the arts. As not a vestige of their writings remains, it is impossible
to judge of the merits of their literary compositions.
I suspect, however, that, like the ancient Egyptians, they had
made much less progress in literature than in arts or science.
What books they had, were extant, and well known, at Rome;
yet Cicero and other Latin writers, who have the Greek authors
perpetually in their mouths, scarcely ever allude to any
works of the Etruscans, except treatises on augury or divination;
and the only titles of the books, recorded by Roman
writers, are the Libri Fatales, Libri Haruspicinæ, Sacra Acherontia,
Fulgurales et Rituales Libri. It is said, indeed, that
the Etruscans cultivated a certain species of poetry, sung or
declaimed during the pomp of sacrifices, or celebration of
    marriages<a id="noteref_59" name="noteref_59" href="#note_59"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">59</span></span></a>. Such verses were first employed in Fescennia,
a city of Etruria, whence the ancient nuptial hymns of the
Romans were called Fescennine. It is evident, however, that
these Etruscan songs, or hymns, were of the very rudest description,
and probably never were reduced into writing.
They were a kind of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">impromptus</span></span>, composed of scurrilous
jests, originally recited by the Italian peasants at those feasts
of Ceres, which celebrated the conclusion of their harvests;
and they resembled the verses described in the well-known
lines of Horace—

Censorinus informs us, on the authority of Varro, that this
ancient people was not without its chroniclers and historians—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">In 
    Tuscis Historiis quæ octavo eorum sæculo scripta sunt</span></span><a id="noteref_62" name="noteref_62" href="#note_62"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">62</span></span></a>. 
But this eighth century of the Etruscans, according to the
chronology followed by Lanzi, would be as late as the sixth
    century of Rome<a id="noteref_63" name="noteref_63" href="#note_63"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">63</span></span></a>; and, besides, it is evident from the context
of Censorinus, that these pretended <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">histories</span></span> were, in
fact, mere registers of the foundations of cities, and the births
and deaths of individuals. Varro also mentions Etruscan
    tragedies composed by Volumnius<a id="noteref_64" name="noteref_64" href="#note_64"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">64</span></span></a>. No date to his productions,
however, is specified, and Lanzi is of opinion, that he
did not write in Etruria till after the dramatic art had made
considerable progress at Rome; and it certainly may at least
be doubted, if, previous to that period, the Etruscan stage
had ever reached higher than extemporary recitations, or
pantomimic entertainments of music and dancing.

But whatever the literature of the Etruscans may have been,
it certainly had no influence on the progress of learning among
the Romans. Neither the intercourse of the two nations,
nor the capture of Veii, though followed by the final subjugation
of the Etruscans, was attended with any literary improvement
on the part of their unpolished neighbours. In
fact, few nations have been more completely illiterate than
the Romans were, during five centuries, from the commencement
of their history; and of all the nations which have figured
in the annals of mankind, none certainly attained the
same height of power and grandeur, and civil wisdom, with
equal ignorance of literature or the fine arts. For the pretended
acquaintance of the elder Brutus with the Pythagorean
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page38">[pg 38]</span><a name="Pg038" id="Pg038" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>philosophy, it would be difficult, I suspect, to find any better
authority than the romance of Clelia; and the learned academy,
    which some writers<a id="noteref_65" name="noteref_65" href="#note_65"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">65</span></span></a> have found in Numa’s College of
Pontiffs, must be classed, I fear, with Vockerodt’s literary societies,
    which existed before the flood<a id="noteref_66" name="noteref_66" href="#note_66"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">66</span></span></a>.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is not difficult to account for this ignorance of the Romans
during the first ages of their history. Rome was not, as
has been asserted by Dionysius, a regular colony sent out from
a well-regulated state, but was formed from a mixture of all
kinds of people unacquainted with social life. It consisted of
Romulus’ own troop, and a confluence of banditti inured to
lawless acts, and subsisting by rapine, who were called from
their fastnesses by the proclamation of a bold, cunning, and
    hardy adventurer<a id="noteref_67" name="noteref_67" href="#note_67"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">67</span></span></a>. This desperate band would not be much
softened or humanized by their union with the tribe of Sabines,
who, in the time of Romulus, became incorporated with the
state, if we may judge of Sabine civilization from the story of
Tarpeia. Numa did much for the domestic melioration of his
people: He subdivided them into classes, impressed their
minds with reverence for religion, and encouraged agriculture;
but there was no germ of literature which he could foster.
For more than three centuries after his death, the persevering
hostilities of neighbouring states, and the furious irruptions of
the Gauls, scarcely allowed a moment of repose or tranquillity.
The safety of Rome depended on its military preparations, and
every citizen necessarily became a soldier. Learning and
arts may flourish amid the wars and commotions of a mighty
empire, because every individual is not essentially or actively
involved in the struggle; but in a petty state, surrounded by
foes, all are in some shape or other personally engaged in the
conflict, and the result, perhaps, is viewed with intenser interest.
The enemies of Rome were repeatedly at her gates, and
once within her walls; and while the city thus resounded with
martial alarms, literary leisure could neither be enjoyed nor
accounted among the ingredients—

The exercise of arms, which commenced in order to preserve
the new-founded city from destruction, was continued
for the sake of conquest and dominion; so that the whole
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page39">[pg 39]</span><a name="Pg039" id="Pg039" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>pride of the Romans was still placed in valour and military
success. At the first formation of their theatre, they were

time could be snatched from warlike occupations, was
devoted to agriculture. Each individual had two acres allotted
to him, which he was obliged to till for the maintenance
of his family. While thus labouring for subsistence, he had
little leisure to cultivate literature or the arts, and could find
no inclination for such pursuits. Indeed, he was not allowed
the choice of his occupations. The law of Romulus which
consigned as ignominious all sedentary employments to foreigners
or slaves, leaving only in choice to citizens and freemen
the arts of agriculture and arms, long continued in undiminished
respect and observance. Romulus, says Dionysius, ordered
the same persons to exercise the employments both of
husbandmen and soldiers. He taught them the duty of soldiers
in time of war, and accustomed them in time of peace
    to cultivate the land<a id="noteref_69" name="noteref_69" href="#note_69"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">69</span></span></a>.

During this period the Romans had nothing which can properly
be termed, or which would now be considered as poetry—the
shape in which literature usually first expands amongst
a rude people. The verses which have come down to us under
the character of Sibylline oracles, are not genuine. There
probably at one time existed a few rude lines uttered by pretended
prophetesses, and which were doubtless a political
instrument, usefully employed in a state subject to popular
commotions. The book delivered to Tarquin, and which was
supposed to contain those ancient oracles, perished amid the
conflagration in the Capitol, during the civil wars of Marius
and Sylla. Even those collected in Greece, and the municipal
states of Italy, in order to supply their place, and which were
deposited in the temple of Apollo, on Mount Palatine, were
burned by Stilicho in the reign of the Emperor Honorius.
There is still extant, however, the hymn sung by the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Fratres
Arvales</span></span>, a college of priests instituted by Romulus, for the
purpose of walking in procession through the fields in the
commencement of spring, and imploring from the gods a blessing
on agriculture. Of a similar description were the rude
Saturnian verses prescribed by Numa, and which were chaunted
by the Salian priests, who carried through the streets those
sacred shields, so long accounted the Palladium of Rome.

About the end of the fourth century from the building of
the city, when it was for the first time afflicted with a plague,
the Senate having exhausted without effect their own super<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page40">[pg 40]</span><a name="Pg040" id="Pg040" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>stitious ceremonies, and run over the whole round of supplications,
decreed that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">histrions</span></span> or players should be summoned
from Etruria, in order to appease the wrath of the gods by
scenic representations. These chiefly exhibited rude dances
    and gesticulations, performed to the sound of the flute<a id="noteref_70" name="noteref_70" href="#note_70"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">70</span></span></a>.
There was no dialogue or song, but the pantomime did not
consist merely of unmeaning gestures: It had a certain scope,
    and represented a connected plot or story<a id="noteref_71" name="noteref_71" href="#note_71"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">71</span></span></a>; but what kind of
action or story was represented, is utterly unknown. This
whimsical sort of expiation seems to have attracted the fancy
of the Roman youths, who imitated the Etruscan actors; but
they improved on the entertainment, by rallying each other in
extemporary and jocular lines. The Fescennine verses, originally
employed in Etruria at the harvest-homes of the peasants,
were about the same period applied by the Romans to marriage
ceremonies and public diversions.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There were also songs of triumph in a rude measure, which
were sung by the soldiers at the ovations of their leaders. As
early as the time of Romulus, when that chief returned triumphant
to Rome after his victory over the Ceninenses and Antemnates,
his soldiers followed him in military array, singing
hymns in honour of their gods, and extemporary verses in praise
    of their commander<a id="noteref_72" name="noteref_72" href="#note_72"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">72</span></span></a>. Of this description, too, were the
Pæans, with which the victorious troops accompanied the
    chariot of Cincinnatus, after he subdued the Equi<a id="noteref_73" name="noteref_73" href="#note_73"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">73</span></span></a>, and with
which they celebrated a spirited enterprize of Cossus, a tribune
    of the soldiers<a id="noteref_74" name="noteref_74" href="#note_74"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">74</span></span></a>. Sometimes these laudatory songs were seasoned
with coarse jokes and camp jests, like those introduced
    at the triumph of C. Claudius, and of M. Livius<a id="noteref_75" name="noteref_75" href="#note_75"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">75</span></span></a>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The triumphal hymns were not altogether confined to the
ceremony performed on the streets of Rome. Cicero informs
us, on the authority of Cato’s <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Origines</span></span>, that at feasts and
entertainments, it was usual for the guests to celebrate the
    praises of their native heroes to the sound of the flute<a id="noteref_76" name="noteref_76" href="#note_76"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">76</span></span></a>. Valerius
Maximus says, that the verses were sung by the older
    guests, in order to excite the youth to emulation<a id="noteref_77" name="noteref_77" href="#note_77"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">77</span></span></a>; and Varro,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page41">[pg 41]</span><a name="Pg041" id="Pg041" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>that they were chaunted by ingenuous youths<a id="noteref_78" name="noteref_78" href="#note_78"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">78</span></span></a>. The difference,
however, between the two authors, is easily reconciled. The
    former speaks of the original composition of these ballads<a id="noteref_79" name="noteref_79" href="#note_79"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">79</span></span></a>,
while Varro, though the passage is imperfect, seems to refer
to a later period, when they were brought out anew for the
entertainment of the guests. Valerius talks of them as poems
or ballads of considerable extent. It was many generations,
however, before the age of Cato, that this practice existed;
and by the time of Cicero, these national and heroic productions,
if they ever had been reduced to writing, were
    no longer extant<a id="noteref_80" name="noteref_80" href="#note_80"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">80</span></span></a>. This is all that can be collected concerning
these legends, from the ancient Roman writers, who had
evidently very imperfect notions and information on the subject.
Niebuhr, however, and M. Schlegel, seem as well
acquainted with their contents as we are with Chevy Chase,
and talk as if these precious relics were lying on their shelves,
or as if they had been personally present at the festivals where
they were recited. They expressed, it seems, feelings purely
patriotic—they contained no inconsiderable admixture of the
marvellous—but even the propensity for what was incredible
was exclusively national in its character—and the Roman
fablers indulged themselves in the creation of no wonders,
which did not redound in some measure to the honour of their
ancestors. They were founded on the oldest traditions concerning
the kings and heroes of the infant city, and the establishment
of the republican form of government. <span class="tei tei-q">“The
fabulous birth of Romulus,”</span> says Schlegel, <span class="tei tei-q">“the rape of the
Sabine women, the most poetical combat of the Horatii and
Curiatii, the pride of Tarquin, the misfortunes and death of
Lucretia, and the establishment of liberty by the elder Brutus—the 
wonderful war with Porsenna, and steadfastness of
Scævola, the banishment of Coriolanus, the war which he
kindled against his country, the subsequent struggle of his
feelings, and the final triumph of his patriotism at the all-powerful
intercession of his mother;—these and the like circumstances,
if they be examined from the proper point of
view, cannot fail to be considered as relics and fragments of
    the ancient heroic traditions and heroic poems of the Romans<a id="noteref_81" name="noteref_81" href="#note_81"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">81</span></span></a>.”</span>
Niebuhr, not contented with insulated ballads, has
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page42">[pg 42]</span><a name="Pg042" id="Pg042" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>imagined the existence of a grand and complete Epopee,
commencing with the accession of Tarquinius Priscus, and
    ending with the battle of Regillus<a id="noteref_82" name="noteref_82" href="#note_82"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">82</span></span></a>. This is a great deal more
information than Cicero or Varro could have afforded us on
the subject.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
However numerous or extensive these ballads may have
been, they soon sunk into oblivion; and in consequence of
the overpowering influence of Greek authors and manners,
they never formed the groundwork of a polished system of
national poetry. The manifold witcheries of the Odyssey, and
the harmony of the noble Hexameter, made so entire a conquest
of the fancy and ears of the Romans, as to leave no
room for an imitation, or even an affectionate preservation,
of the ancient poems of their country, and led them, as we
shall soon see, exclusively to adopt in their stead, the thoughts,
the recollections, and the poetry of the Greeks. Cicero, in
his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tusculan Disputations</span></span>, mentions a poem by Appius
    Claudius Cæcus, who flourished in the fifth century of Rome<a id="noteref_83" name="noteref_83" href="#note_83"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">83</span></span></a>;
but he does not say what was the nature or subject of this
production, except that it was Pythagorean; and this is the
solitary authentic notice transmitted to us of the existence of
any thing which can be supposed to have been a regular or
continued poem, during the first five centuries that elapsed
from the building of the city.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Since, then, we can discover, during this period, nothing
but those feeble dawings of dramatic, satiric, and heroic poetry,
which never brightened to a perfect day, the only history
of Roman literature which can be given during the long interval,
consists in the progress and improvement of the Latin
language. In the course of these five centuries, it was extremely
variable, from two causes.—1st, Although their policy
in this respect afterwards changed, one of the great
principles of aggrandizement among the Romans in their early
ages, was incorporating aliens, and admitting them to the
rights of citizens. Hence, there was a constant influx to
Rome of stranger tribes; and the dissonance within its walls
was probably greater than had yet been any where heard since
the memorable confusion at Babel.—2d, The Latin was
merely a spoken language, or at least had not received stability
by literary composition—writing at that time being
confined, (in consequence of the want of materials for it,) to
treaties, or short columnar inscriptions. So remarkable was
the fluctuation produced by these causes, even during a very
short period, that Polybius, speaking of a treaty concluded
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page43">[pg 43]</span><a name="Pg043" id="Pg043" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>between the Carthaginians and Romans in the 245th Year of
the City, during the Consulship of Publius Valerius and Marcus
Horatius, declares, that the language used in it was so
different from the Latin spoken in his time, that the most
    learned Romans could not explain its text<a id="noteref_84" name="noteref_84" href="#note_84"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">84</span></span></a>.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Of this changeable tongue, the earliest specimen extant,
and which is supposed to be as ancient as the time of Romulus,
is the hymn chaunted by the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Fratres Arvales</span></span>, the college
of priests above-mentioned, who were called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Fratres</span></span>, from
the first members of the institution being the sons of Acca
Laurentia, the nurse of Romulus. This song was inscribed,
    during the time of the Emperor Heliogabalus<a id="noteref_85" name="noteref_85" href="#note_85"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">85</span></span></a>, on a stone,
which was discovered on opening the foundations of the Sacristy
at St Peter’s, in the year 1778. It is in the following
words:—
</p>

<div class="tei tei-lg" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em; margin-left: 2.00em; margin-top: 1.00em">

<div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left"><span class="tei tei-q" style="text-align: left">“Enos Lases juvate,</span></div>

</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These words have been thus interpreted by Herman: <span class="tei tei-q">“Nos
Lares juvate, neve luem Mamuri sinis incurrere in plures.
Satur fueris Mars: limen (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i. e.</span></span> postremum) sali sta vervex:

in the above inscription; and it appears from it, that at this
early period the letter <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">s</span></span> was frequently used instead of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">r</span></span>—that
the final <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e</span></span> was struck out, or rather, had not yet been added—the 
rich diphthong <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ei</span></span> was employed instead of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i</span></span>, and the
simple letter <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">p</span></span>, in words where <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">f</span></span> or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ph</span></span> came afterwards to
be substituted.

Of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Carmen Saliare</span></span>, sung by the Salian priests, appointed

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page44">[pg 44]</span><a name="Pg044" id="Pg044" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Shields, there remain only a few words, which have been cited
by Varro, who remarks in them, what has already been noticed
with regard to the Hymn of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Fratres Arvales</span></span>, that the letter
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">s</span></span> often occurs in words where his contemporaries placed
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">r</span></span>—as Melios, for melior—Plusima, for plurima—Asena, for

can scarcely be taken as a fair specimen of the state of the
Roman language at the time it was composed. Among the
nations adjacent to Rome, there were Salian priests, who had
    their hymns and solemn forms of invocation<a id="noteref_88" name="noteref_88" href="#note_88"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">88</span></span></a>, which are said
    to have been, in part at least, adopted by Numa<a id="noteref_89" name="noteref_89" href="#note_89"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">89</span></span></a>. So that
his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Carmen Saliare</span></span> probably approaches nearer to the Tuscan
and Oscan dialects, than the Latin language did, even at
that early period of the monarchy.

The fragments of a few laws, attributed to Numa, have been
preserved by ancient jurisconsults and grammarians, and restored
by Festus, with much pains, to their proper orthography,
which had not been sufficiently attended to by those who first
cited passages from this <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Regiam Majestatem</span></span> of the Romans.
One of these laws, as restored by him, is in the following
terms:—<span class="tei tei-q">“Sei cuips hemonem lobsum dolo sciens mortei duit
pariceidad estod. sei im imprudens se dolo malod occisit pro
capited oceisei et nateis eiius endo concioned arietem subicitod,”</span>
which law may be thus interpreted: <span class="tei tei-q">“Si quis hominem
liberum dolo sciens morti dederit parricida esto: Si cum imprudens,
sine dolo malo, occiderit, pro capite occisi et natis
ejus in concionem arietem subjicito.”</span> A law, ascribed to
Servius Tullius, has been thus given by Festus:—<span class="tei tei-q">“Sei parentem
puer verberit ast oloe plorasit, puer diveis parentum sacer
esto—sei nurus sacra diveis parentum esto,”</span>—which means,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Si parentem puer verberet, at ille ploraverit, puer divis parentum
    sacer esto; si nurus, sacra divis parentum esto”</span><a id="noteref_90" name="noteref_90" href="#note_90"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">90</span></span></a>.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From the date of these <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Leges Regiæ</span></span>, no specimen of the
Latin language is now extant, till we come down to the
Twelve Tables, enacted in the commencement of the fourth
century of Rome. These celebrated institutions have descended
to us in mutilated fragments, and their orthography
has probably been in some respects modernised: yet they bear
stronger marks of antiquity than the above-recited law of
Servius Tullius, or even than those of Numa. The Latin
writers themselves by whom they are quoted did not very well
understand them, owing to the change which had taken place
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page45">[pg 45]</span><a name="Pg045" id="Pg045" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>in the language. Accordingly, Cicero, and the early grammarians
who cite them, have attempted rather to give the
meaning than the precise words of the Decemvirs. Terrasson
has endeavoured to bring them back to the old Oscan language,
in which he supposes them to have been originally written;
but his emendations are in a great measure conjectural, and
his attempt is one of more promise than fulfilment. On the
whole, they have been so much corrupted by modernising
them, and by subsequent attempts to restore them to the
ancient readings, that they cannot be implicitly relied on as
specimens of the Roman language during the period in which
they were promulgated. The laws themselves are very concise,
and free from that tautology, which seems the characteristic
of the enactments of nations farther advanced in
refinement. The first law is, <span class="tei tei-q">“S’ in jus vocat queat,”</span> which
is extremely elliptical in its expression, and means, <span class="tei tei-q">“Si quis
aliquem in jus vocet, vocatus eat.”</span> In some respects the language
of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Leges Regiæ</span></span>, and twelve tables, possesses a
richness of sound, which we do not find in more modern Latin,
particularly in the use of the diphthong <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ai</span></span> for <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">æ</span></span>, as vitai for
vitæ, and of the diphthong <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ei</span></span> for <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i</span></span>, as sei for si. Horace might
perhaps be well entitled to ridicule the person,

There is scarcely a vestige of the Latin language remaining
during the two centuries which succeeded the enactment of
the twelve tables. At the end of that long period, and during
the first Punic war, a celebrated inscription, which is still
extant, recorded the naval victory obtained by the Consul
Duillius, in 492, over the Carthaginians. The column on
which it was engraved, and which became so famous by the
    title of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Columna Rostrata</span></span>, was, as Livy<a id="noteref_91" name="noteref_91" href="#note_91"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">91</span></span></a> informs us, struck
down by lightning during the interval between the second and

The celebrated Eugubian tables were so called from having
been found at Eugubium (Gubbio) a city in ancient Umbria,
near the foot of the Apennines, where they were dug up
in 1444. When first discovered, they were believed to be in
the Egyptian language; but it was afterwards observed that
five of the seven tables were in the Etruscan character and language,
or rather in the Umbrian dialect of that tongue, and the
other two in Roman letters, though in a rustic jargon, between
Latin and <a name="corr047" id="corr047" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">Etruscan</span>, with such mixture of each, as might be

the Latin character were written towards the close of the sixth
century of Rome, and those in the Etruscan letters a short
while previous. So little, however, was the Etruscan language
fixed or understood, even in the middle of last century, when
the Etruscan rage was at its height in Italy, that Bonarota
believed that those tables contained treaties of the ancient
Italian nations—Gori, an Oscan poem, and Maffei, legal enactments,
till Passerius at length discovered that they consisted
solely of ordinances for the performance of sacred rites and
    religious ceremonies.<a id="noteref_96" name="noteref_96" href="#note_96"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">96</span></span></a>

On comparing the fragments of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Leges Regiæ</span></span> with the
Duillian and Scipian inscriptions, it does not appear that the
Roman language, however greatly it may have varied, had
either improved or approached much nearer to modern Latin
in the fifth century than in the time of the kings. Short and
mutilated as these laws and inscriptions are, they still enable
us to draw many important conclusions with regard to the
general state of the language during the existence of the monarchy,
and the first ages of the republic. It has already been
mentioned that the <a name="corr048" id="corr048" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">diphthong</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ai</span></span> was employed where <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ae</span></span> came
to be afterwards substituted, as aide for æde; <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ei</span></span> instead of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i</span></span>,
as castreis for castris; and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">oi</span></span> in place of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">œ</span></span>, as coilum for cœlum.
The vowel <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e</span></span> is often introduced instead of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">o</span></span>, as hemo
for homo, while, on the other hand, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">o</span></span> is sometimes used instead
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e</span></span>, as vostrum for vestrum; and Scipio Africanus is
said to have been the first who always wrote the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e</span></span> in such
    words<a id="noteref_97" name="noteref_97" href="#note_97"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">97</span></span></a>. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">U</span></span> is frequently changed into <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">o</span></span>, as honc for hunc,
sometimes into <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ou</span></span>, as abdoucit for abducit, and sometimes to
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">oi</span></span>, as oino for uno. On the whole, it appears that the vowels
were in a great measure used indiscriminately, and often,
especially in inscriptions, they were altogether omitted, as
bne for bene, though sometimes, again, an <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e</span></span> final was added,
as face for fac, dice for dic. As to the consonants,—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span> at the
beginning of a word was <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">du</span></span>, as duonorum for bonorum, and
it was <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">p</span></span> at the middle or end, as opsides for obsides. The
letter <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">g</span></span> certainly does not appear in those earliest specimens
of the Latin language—the hymn of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Fratres Arvales</span></span>, and
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Leges Regiæ</span></span>, where <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">c</span></span> is used in its place. Plutarch says, that
this letter was utterly unknown at Rome during the space of
five centuries, and was first introduced by the grammarian
    Spurius Carvillius in the year 540<a id="noteref_98" name="noteref_98" href="#note_98"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">98</span></span></a>. It occurs, however, in
the epitaph of Scipio Barbatus, which was written at least
half a century before that date; and, what is remarkable, it is
there placed in a word where <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">c</span></span> was previously and subsequently
employed, Gnaivo being written for Cnæo. The
Letter <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">r</span></span> was not, as has been asserted, unknown to the ancient
Romans, but it was chiefly used in the beginning and end
of words—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">s</span></span> being employed instead of it in the middle, as
    lases for lares. Frequently the letters <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">m</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">s</span></span> were omitted
at the end of words, especially, for the sake of euphony, when
the following word began with a consonant—thus we have
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page49">[pg 49]</span><a name="Pg049" id="Pg049" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Aleria cepit, for Aleriam cepit. The ancient Romans were
equally careful to avoid a hiatus of vowels, and hence they
wrote sin in place of si in. Double consonants were never
    seen till the time of Ennius<a id="noteref_99" name="noteref_99" href="#note_99"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">99</span></span></a>; and we accordingly find in the
old inscriptions sumas for summas: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">er</span></span> was added to the infinitive
passive, as darier for dari, and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">d</span></span> was subjoined to words
ending with a vowel, as in altod, marid, pucnandod. It likewise
appears that the Romans were for a long period unacquainted
with the use of aspirates, and were destitute of the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">phi</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">chi</span></span> sounds of the Greek alphabet. Hence they wrote
    triumpe for triumphe, and pulcer for pulcher<a id="noteref_100" name="noteref_100" href="#note_100"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">100</span></span></a>. We also meet
with a good many words, particularly substantives, which
afterwards became altogether obsolete, and some are applied
in a sense different from that in which they were subsequently
used. Finally, a difference in the conjugation of the same
verb, and a want of inflection in nouns, particularly proper
names of countries or cities, where the nominative frequently
occurs instead of the accusative, show the unsettled state of
the language at that early period<span class="tei tei-add"><a id="noteref_101" name="noteref_101" href="#note_101"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">101</span></span></a></span>.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is unnecessary to prosecute farther the history of Roman
inscriptions, since, immediately after the erection of the Duillian
column in 494, Latin became a written literary language;
and although the diphthongs <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ai</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ei</span></span> were retained for more
than a century longer, most of the other archaisms were totally
rejected, and the language was so enriched by a more
copious admixture of the Greek, that, while always inferior to
that tongue, in ease, precision, perspicuity, and copiousness,
it came at length to rival it in dignity of enunciation, and in
that lofty accent which harmonized so well with the elevated
character of the people by whom it was uttered.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This sudden improvement in language, as well as the
equally sudden revolution in taste and literature by which it
was accompanied, must be entirely and exclusively attributed
to the conquest of Magna Græcia, and the intercourse opened
to the Romans with the Greek colonies of Sicily. Their
minds were, no doubt, in some measure prepared, during the
five centuries which had followed the foundation of the city,
for receiving the seeds of learning. The very existence of
social life for so long a period must have in some degree
reclaimed them from their native barbarism. Freed from
hourly alarms excited by the attacks of foes whose territories
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page50">[pg 50]</span><a name="Pg050" id="Pg050" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>reached almost to the gates of the city, it was now possible
for them to enjoy those pleasures which can only be relished
in tranquillity; but their genius, I believe, would have remained
unproductive and cold for half a millennium longer,
had it not been kindled by contact with a more polished and
animated nation, whose compositions could not be read without
enthusiasm, or imitated without advantage.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
However uncertain may be the story concerning the arrival
of Œnotrus in the south of Italy, the passage of the Pelasgi
from Epirus to the Po, seventeen generations before the Trojan
war, or the settlement of the Arcadian Evander in Latium,
there can be no doubt, that, about the commencement of the
Roman æra, the dissensions of the reigning families of Greece,
the commotions which pervaded its realms, the suggestions of
oracles, the uncertain tenure of landed property, the restless
spirit of adventure, and seasons of famine, all co-operated
in producing an emigration of numerous tribes, chiefly
Dorians and Achæans of Peloponnesus, who founded colonies
on the coasts of Asia, the Ægean islands, and Italy. In this
latter country, (which seems in all ages to have been the resort
and refuse of a redundant or unfortunate population,)
the Greek strangers first settled in a southern district, then
known by the ancient name of Iapygia, and since denominated
Calabria. Serenity of climate, joined to the vigour of laws,
simplicity of manners, and the energy peculiar to every rising
community, soon procured these colonies an enviable increase
of prosperity and power. They gradually drove the native
inhabitants to the interior of the country, and formed a political
state, which assumed the magnificent name of Magna
Græcia—an appellation which was by degrees applied to the
whole coast which bounds the bay of Tarentum. On that
shore, about half a century after the foundation of Rome,
arose the flourishing and philosophic town of Crotona, and the
voluptuous city of Sybaris. These were the consolidated
possessions of the Grecian colonies; but they had also scattered
seats all along the western coast of the territory which
now forms the kingdom of Naples.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As in most other states, corruption of manners was the consequence
of prosperity and the cause of decay. Towards the
close of the third century of Rome, Pythagoras had in some
measure succeeded in reforming the morals of Crotona, while
the rival state of Sybaris, like the Moorish Grenada, hastened
to destruction, amid carousals and civil dissensions; and
though once capable, as is said, (but probably with some
exaggeration,) of bringing three hundred thousand soldiers
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page51">[pg 51]</span><a name="Pg051" id="Pg051" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>into the field<a id="noteref_102" name="noteref_102" href="#note_102"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">102</span></span></a>, it sunk, after a short struggle, under the power
of Crotona. The other independent states were successively
agitated by the violence of popular revolution, and crushed
by the severity of despotism. As in the mother country, they
had constant dissensions among themselves. This rivalship
induced them to call in the assistance of the Sicilians—a
measure which prepared the way for their subjection to the
vigorous but detestable sway of the elder Dionysius, and of
Agathocles. Tarentum, founded about the same time with
Sybaris and Crotona, was the most powerful city of the Grecian
colonies toward the conclusion of their political existence,
and the last formidable rival to the Romans in Italy. Like
the neighbouring states, it was chiefly ruined by the succour
of foreign allies. Unsuccessfully defended by Alexander Molossus,
oppressed by the Syracusan tyrants, and despoiled by
Cleomenes of Sparta, neither the genius of Pyrrhus, nor the
power of Carthage, could preserve it from the necessity of
final submission to the Romans.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In all their varieties of fortune, the Grecian colonies had
maintained the manners and institutions of the mother country,
which no people ever entirely relinquish with the soil
they have left. A close political connection also subsisted
between them; and, about the year 300 of Rome, the Athenians
sent to the assistance of Sybaris a powerful expedition,
which, on the decay of that city, founded the town of
Thurium in the immediate vicinity. This constant intercourse
cherished and preserved the literary spirit of the colonies of
Magna Græcia. Herodotus, the father of history, and Lysias,
whose orations are the purest models of the simple Attic
eloquence, were, in early youth, among the original founders
    of the colony of Thurium<a id="noteref_103" name="noteref_103" href="#note_103"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">103</span></span></a>, and the latter held a share in its
government till an advanced period of life. The Eleatic
school of philosophy was founded in Magna Græcia; and the
impulse which the wisdom of Pythagoras had given to the
mind, promoted also the studies of literature. Plato visited
Tarentum during the consulship of Lucius Camillus and
    Appius Claudius<a id="noteref_104" name="noteref_104" href="#note_104"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">104</span></span></a>, which was in the 406th year of Rome, and
Zeuxis was invited from Greece to paint at Crotona the magnificent
    temple of Juno, which had been erected in that city<a id="noteref_105" name="noteref_105" href="#note_105"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">105</span></span></a>.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page52">[pg 52]</span><a name="Pg052" id="Pg052" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>History and poetry were cultivated with a success which did
not dishonour the Grecian name. Lycus of Rhegium was
the civil, and Glaucus of the same city was the literary historian
of Magna Græcia. Orpheus of Crotona was the author
of a poem on the expedition of the Argonauts, attributed to
an elder Orpheus. The lyric productions of Ibicus of Rhegium
rivalled those of Anacreon and Alcæus. Two hundred
and fifty-five comedies, written by Alexis of Thurium, the titles
of which have been collected by Meursius, and a few fragments
of them by Stephens, are said to have been composed
in the happiest vein of the middle comedy of the Greeks,
which possessed much of the comic force of Aristophanes and
Cratinus, without their malignity. In his Meropis and Ancylio,
this dramatist is supposed to have carped at Plato; and
his comedy founded on the life of Pythagoras, was probably
in a similar vein of satire. Stephano, the son of Alexis, and
who, according to Suidas, was the uncle of Menander, became
chiefly celebrated for his tragedies; but his comedies were
also distinguished by happy pictures of life, and uncommon
harmony of versification.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
War, which had so long retarded the progress of literature
at Rome, at length became the cause of its culture. The
Romans were now involved in a contest with the civilized
colonies of Magna Græcia. Accordingly, when they garrisoned
Thurium, in order to defend it against the Samnites,
and when in 482 they obtained complete possession of Magna
Græcia, by the capture of Tarentum, which presented the last
resistance to their arms, they could not fail to catch a portion
of Grecian taste and spirit, or at least to admire the beautiful
creations of Grecian fancy. Many of the conquerors remained
in Magna Græcia, while, on the other hand, all the inhabitants
of its cities, who were most distinguished for literary attainments,
fixed their residence at Rome.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The first Carthaginian war, which broke out in 489, so far
from retarding the literary influence of these strangers, accelerated
the steps of improvement. Unlike the former contests
of the Romans, which were either with neighbouring states,
or with barbarous nations who came to attack them in their
own territories, it was not attended with that immediate danger
which is utterly inconsistent with literary leisure. In its prosecution,
too, the Romans for the first time carried their arms
beyond Italy. Literature, indeed, was not one of those novelties
in which the western part of Africa was fruitful, but, with
the exception of Greece itself, there was no country where it
flourished more luxuriantly than in Sicily; and that island, as
is well known, was the principal scene of the first great strug<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page53">[pg 53]</span><a name="Pg053" id="Pg053" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>gle between Rome and Carthage. None of the Grecian colonies
shone with such splendour as Syracuse, a city founded
by the Dorians of Corinth, in the 19th year of Rome. This
capital had attained the summit both of political and literary
renown long before the first Carthaginian war. Æschylus
passed the concluding years of his life in Sicily, and wrote, it
is said, his tragedy of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Persians</span></span>, to gratify the curiosity of
Hiero I. King of Syracuse, who was desirous to see a representation
of the celebrated war which the Greeks had waged
against Xerxes. Epicharmus, retained in the same elegant
court, was the first who rejected, on the stage, the ancient
mummeries of the satires, and composed dramas on that regular
elaborate plan, which was reckoned worthy of imitation by
Plautus—

Dionysius, the tyrant, was also a patron of learning, and was
himself a competitor in the fields of literature. Philistus, the
historian, was the friend of the elder, and Plato of the younger
Dionysius. Aristippus and Æschines passed some time in the
court of these tyrants. Theocritus, and other poets of the
Alexandrian constellation, resided in Sicily before they partook
in Egypt of the splendid patronage of the Ptolemies.
The Syracusans, who put to death so many of their Athenian
prisoners in cold blood, and with frightful tortures, spared
those of them who could recite the verses of Euripides. Scenic
representations were peculiarly popular in Sicily: Its
towns were crowded with theatres, and its dramatists were
loaded with honours. The theatrical exhibitions which the
Roman invaders of Sicily must have witnessed, and the respect
there paid to distinguished poets, would naturally awaken literary
emulation. During a contest of nearly twenty-four years
between Rome and Carthage, Hiero II., King of Syracuse,
was the zealous and strenuous ally of the Romans. At the
conclusion of peace between these rival nations, in the year
512, part of Sicily was ceded to the Romans, and the intercourse
which consequently arose with the inhabitants of this
newly-acquired territory, laid the foundation of those studies,
which were afterwards brought to perfection by the progress
    of time, and by direct communication with Greece itself<a id="noteref_107" name="noteref_107" href="#note_107"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">107</span></span></a>.

Accordingly, it is in the end of the fifth, and beginning of
the sixth century, from the building of Rome, that we find
among its inhabitants the earliest vestiges of literature. Poetry,
as with most other nations, was the first of the liberal arts
which was cultivated among the Romans; and dramatic poetry,
founded on the school of Greece, appears to have been that
which was earliest preferred. We have seen, indeed, that
previous to this period, and in the year 392, when the city
was afflicted with a plague, the Senate decreed that players
should be summoned from Etruria to appease the wrath of the
gods by scenic representations, and that the Roman youth
imitated these expiatory performances, by rallying each other
in extemporary verses. This by some has been considered as
a dawning of the drama, since the characters probably bore a
resemblance to the Arlequin and Scaramouch of the Italian
farces. But

    was made captive and brought to Rome<a id="noteref_109" name="noteref_109" href="#note_109"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">109</span></span></a>. It is generally believed
that he there became the slave, and afterwards the
freedman of Livius Salinator, from whom he derived one of
his names: these facts, however, do not seem to rest on any
    authority more ancient than the Eusebian Chronicle<a id="noteref_110" name="noteref_110" href="#note_110"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">110</span></span></a>. The
precise period of his death is uncertain; but in Cicero’s Dialogue
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De Senectute</span></span>, Cato is introduced saying, that he had
    seen old Livius while he was himself a youth<a id="noteref_111" name="noteref_111" href="#note_111"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">111</span></span></a>. Now Cato
was born in 519, and since the period of youth among the
Romans was considered as commencing at fifteen, it may be
presumed that the existence of Livius was at least protracted
till the year 534 of the city. It has been frequently said, that
    he lived till the year 546<a id="noteref_112" name="noteref_112" href="#note_112"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">112</span></span></a>, because Livy<a id="noteref_113" name="noteref_113" href="#note_113"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">113</span></span></a> mentions that a
hymn composed by this ancient poet was publicly sung in that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page55">[pg 55]</span><a name="Pg055" id="Pg055" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>year, to avert the disasters threatened by an alarming prodigy;
but the historian does not declare that it was written for the
occasion, or even recently before.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The earliest play of Livius was represented in 513 or 514,
about a year after the termination of the first Punic war. Osannus,
a modern German author, has written a learned and chronological
dissertation on the question, in which of these years
    the first Roman play was performed<a id="noteref_114" name="noteref_114" href="#note_114"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">114</span></span></a>; but it is extremely difficult
for us to come to any satisfactory conclusion on a subject
which, even in the time of Cicero, was one of doubt and
    controversy<a id="noteref_115" name="noteref_115" href="#note_115"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">115</span></span></a>. Like Thespis, and other dramatists in the commencement
of the theatrical art, Livius was an actor, and for
a considerable time the sole performer in his own pieces.
Afterwards, however, his voice failing, in consequence of the
audience insisting on a repetition of favourite passages, he introduced
a boy who relieved him, by declaiming in concert
with the flute, while he himself executed the corresponding
gesticulations in the monologues, and in the parts where high
exertion was required, employing his own voice only in the
    conversational and less elevated scenes<a id="noteref_116" name="noteref_116" href="#note_116"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">116</span></span></a>. It was observed
that his action grew more lively and animated, because he
exerted his whole strength in gesticulating, while another had
the care and trouble of pronouncing. <span class="tei tei-q">“Hence,”</span> continues
Livy, <span class="tei tei-q">“the practice arose of reciting those passages which
required much modulation of the voice, to the gesture and
action of the comedian. Thenceforth the custom so far prevailed,
that the comedians never pronounced anything except
    the verses of the dialogues<a id="noteref_117" name="noteref_117" href="#note_117"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">117</span></span></a>:”</span> And this system, which one
should think must have completely destroyed the theatric illusion,
continued, under certain modifications, to subsist on the
Roman stage during the most refined periods of taste and literature.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The popularity of Livius increasing from these performances,
as well as from a propitiatory hymn he had composed,
and which had been followed by great public success, a
building was assigned to him on the Aventine hill. This
edifice was partly converted into a theatre, and was also in<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page56">[pg 56]</span><a name="Pg056" id="Pg056" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>habited by a troop of players, for whom Livius wrote his
    pieces, and frequently acted along with them<a id="noteref_118" name="noteref_118" href="#note_118"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">118</span></span></a>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It has been disputed whether the first drama represented
    by Livius Andronicus at Rome was a tragedy or comedy<a id="noteref_119" name="noteref_119" href="#note_119"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">119</span></span></a>.
However this may be, it appears from the names which have
been preserved of his plays, that he wrote both tragedies and
comedies. These titles, which have been collected by Fabricius
and other writers, are, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Achilles</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Adonis</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ægisthus</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ajax</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Andromeda</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Antiopa</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Centauri</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Equus Trojanus</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Helena</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hermione</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ino</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lydius</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Protesilaodamia</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Serenus</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tereus</span></span>,
    <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Teucer</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Virgo</span></span><a id="noteref_120" name="noteref_120" href="#note_120"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">120</span></span></a>. Such names also evince that most of his
dramas were translated or imitated from the works of his
countrymen of Magna Græcia, or from the great tragedians
of Greece. Thus, Æschylus wrote a tragedy on the subject
of Ægisthus: There is still an Ajax of Sophocles extant, and
he is known to have written an Andromeda: Stobæus mentions
the Antiopa of Euripides: Four Greek dramatists, Sophocles,
Euripides, Anaxandrides, and Philæterus, composed
tragedies on the subject of Tereus; and Epicharmus, as well
as others, chose for their comedies the story of the Syrens.

Little, however, except the titles, remains to us, from the
dramas of Livius. The longest passage we possess in connection,
extends only to four lines. It forms part of a hymn
to Diana, recited by the chorus, in the tragedy of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ino</span></span>, and
contains an animated exhortation to a person about to proceed
to the chase:—

This passage testifies the vast improvement effected by Livius
on the Latin Tongue; and indeed the polish of the language
and metrical correctness of these hexameter lines, have of
late led to a suspicion that they are not the production of a
    period so ancient as the age of Livius<a id="noteref_122" name="noteref_122" href="#note_122"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">122</span></span></a>, or at least that they

offspring of the Latin muse, it may be curious to compare a
production from her last age of decrepitude. Nemesianus, in
his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cynegeticon</span></span>, has closely imitated this passage while exhorting
Diana to prepare for the chase:

As the above-quoted verses in the chorus of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ino</span></span> are the
only passage among the fragments of Livius, from which a
connected meaning can be elicited, we must take our opinion
of his poetical merits from those who judged of them while
his writings <a name="corr057" id="corr057" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">were</span> yet wholly extant. Cicero has pronounced
an unfavourable decision, declaring that they scarcely deserved
    a second perusal<a id="noteref_123" name="noteref_123" href="#note_123"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">123</span></span></a>. They long, however, continued popular
in Rome, and were read by the youths in schools even during
the Augustan age of poetry. It is evident, indeed, that during
that golden period of Roman literature, there prevailed a taste
corresponding to our black-letter rage, which led to an inordinate
admiration of the works of Livius, and to the bitter
complaints of Horace, that they should be extolled as perfect,
or held up by old pedants to the imitation of youth in an age
when so much better models existed:

But although Livius may have been too much read in the
schools, and too much admired in an age, which could boast
of models so greatly superior to his writings, he is at least
entitled to praise, as the inventor among the Romans of a
species of poetry which was afterwards carried by them to
much higher perfection. By translating the Odyssey, too, into
Latin verse, he adopted the means which, of all others, was
most likely to foster and improve the infant literature of his
country—as he thus presented it with an image of the most
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page58">[pg 58]</span><a name="Pg058" id="Pg058" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>pure and perfect taste, and at the same time with those wild
and romantic adventures, which are best suited to attract the
sympathy and interest of a half-civilized nation. This happy
influence could not be prevented even by the use of the rugged
Saturnian verse, which led Cicero to compare the translation
of Livius to the ancient statues, which might be attributed
    to Dædalus<a id="noteref_125" name="noteref_125" href="#note_125"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">125</span></span></a>.

From the æra in which the dramatic productions of Livius
appeared, theatrical representations formed the object of a
peculiar art. The more regular drama, founded on that of
Magna Græcia, or Sicily, being divided into tragedy and comedy,
became, in a great measure, the province of professional
players or authors, while the Roman youths of distinction continued

A native of Campania, was the first imitator of the regular
dramatic works which had been produced by Livius Andronicus.
He served in the first Punic war, and his earliest plays

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Nævius, however, was accounted a better comic than tragic
poet. Cicero has given us some specimens of his jests, with
which that celebrated wit and orator appears to have been
greatly amused; but they consist rather in unexpected turns
of expression, or a play of words, than in genuine humour.
One of these, recorded in the second Book <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De Oratore</span></span>, has
found its way into our jest-books; and though one of the best
in Cicero, it is one of the worst of Joe Miller. It is the saying
of a knavish servant, <span class="tei tei-q">“that nothing was shut up from him
in his master’s house”</span>.—<span class="tei tei-q">“Solum esse, cui domi nihil sit nec
obsignatum, nec occlusum: Quod idem,”</span> adds Cicero, <span class="tei tei-q">“in
bono servo dici solet, sed hoc iisdem etiam verbis.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Unfortunately for Nævius, he did not always confine himself
in his comedies to such inoffensive jests. The dramas of
Magna Græcia and Sicily, especially those of Epicharmus,
were the prototypes of the older Greek comedy; and accordingly
the most ancient Latin plays, particularly those of
Nævius, which were formed on the same school, though there
be no evidence that they ridiculed political events, partook of
the personal satire and invective which pervaded the productions
of Aristophanes. If, as is related, the comedies of
Nævius were directed against the vices and corporal defects
of the Consuls and Senators of Rome, he must have been the
most original of the Latin comic poets, and infinitely more so
than Plautus or Terence; since although he may have parodied
or copied the dramatic fables of the ancient Greek or Sicilian
comedies, the spirit and colouring of the particular scenes
must have been his own. The elder Scipio was one of the
chief objects of his satiric representations, and the poetic
severity with which Aristophanes persecuted Socrates or Euripides,
was hardly more indecent and misdirected than the
sarcasms of Nævius against the greatest captain, the most
accomplished scholar, and the most virtuous citizen of his age.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page60">[pg 60]</span><a name="Pg060" id="Pg060" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Some lines are still extant, in which he lampooned Scipio on

The conqueror of Hannibal treated these libels with the
same indifference with which Cæsar afterwards regarded the
lines of Catullus. Nævius, however, did not long escape with
impunity. Rome was a very different sort of republic from
Athens: It was rather an aristocracy than a democracy, and
its patricians were not always disposed to tolerate the taunts
and insults which the chiefs of the Greek <a name="corr060" id="corr060" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">democracy</span> were
obliged to endure. Nævius had said in one of his verses, that
the patrician family of the Metelli had frequently obtained the
Consulship before the age permitted by law, and he insinuated
that they had been promoted to this dignity, not in consequence
of their virtues, but the cruelty of the Roman fate:

With the assistance of the other patricians, the Metelli retorted
his sarcasms in a Saturnian stanza, not unlike the
measure of some of our old ballads, in which they threatened
to play the devil with their witty persecutor—

The Metelli, however, did not confine their vengeance to this
ingenious and spirited satire, in the composition of which, it
may be presumed that the whole Roman Senate was engaged.
On account of the unceasing abuse and reproaches which he
had uttered against them, and other chief men of the city, he
was thrown into prison, where he wrote his comedies, the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hariolus</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Leontes</span></span>. These plays being in some measure

relapsed into his former courses, and continued to persecute
the nobility in his dramas and satires with such implacable
    dislike, that he was at length driven from Rome by their in<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page61">[pg 61]</span><a name="Pg061" id="Pg061" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>fluence, and having retired to Utica<a id="noteref_131" name="noteref_131" href="#note_131"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">131</span></span></a>, he died there, in the

somewhat later. Before leaving Rome, he had composed the
following epitaph on himself, which Gellius remarks is full of
Campanian arrogance; though the import of it, he adds, might
    be allowed to be true, had it been written by another<a id="noteref_133" name="noteref_133" href="#note_133"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">133</span></span></a>;

Besides his comedies and the above epitaph, Nævius was
also author of the Cyprian Iliad, a translation from a Greek
poem, called the <a name="corr061" id="corr061" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cyprian Epic</span></span></span>. Aristotle, in the 23d chapter

he says, had furnished many subjects for the drama. Some
writers, particularly Pindar, have attributed this Greek poem
to Homer; and there was long an idle story current, that he
had given it as a portion to his daughter Arsephone. Herodotus,
in his second Book, concludes, after some critical discussion,
that it was not written by Homer, but that it was
doubtless the work of a contemporary poet, or one who lived
shortly after him. Heyne thinks it most probable, that it was
by a poet called Stasinus, a native of the island of Cyprus,
    and that it received its name from the country of its author<a id="noteref_135" name="noteref_135" href="#note_135"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">135</span></span></a>.
Whoever may have written this Cyprian Epic, it contained
twelve books, and was probably a work of amorous and
romantic fiction. It commenced with the nuptials of Thetis
and Peleus—it related the contention of the three goddesses
on Mount Ida—the fables concerning Palamedes—the story of
the daughters of Anius—and the love adventures of the Phrygian
fair during the early period of the siege of Troy—and it
terminated with the council of the gods, at which it was resolved
that Achilles should be withdrawn from the war, by
    sowing dissension between him and Atrides<a id="noteref_136" name="noteref_136" href="#note_136"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">136</span></span></a>.

A metrical chronicle, which chiefly related the events of
the first Punic war, was another, and probably the last work
of Nævius, since Cicero says, that in writing it he filled up
the leisure of his latter days with wonderful complacency and
    satisfaction<a id="noteref_137" name="noteref_137" href="#note_137"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">137</span></span></a>. It was originally undivided; but, after his

yet it also afforded a rapid sketch of the preceding incidents
of Roman history. It commenced with the flight of Æneas
    from Carthage, in a ship built by Mercury<a id="noteref_139" name="noteref_139" href="#note_139"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">139</span></span></a>; and the early
wars of the Romans were detailed in the first and second
books. To judge by the fragments which remain, the whole
work appears to have been full of mythological machinery.
Macrobius informs us, that some lines of this production
described the Romans tost by a tempest, and represented
Venus complaining of the hardships which they suffered to
Jupiter, who consoles her by a prospect of their future glory—a
passage which probably suggested those verses in the first
book of the Æneid, where Venus, in like manner, complains
to Jupiter of the danger experienced by her son in a storm,
    and the god consoles her by assurances of his ultimate prosperity<a id="noteref_140" name="noteref_140" href="#note_140"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">140</span></span></a>.
Cicero mentions, that Ennius, too, though he classes
Nævius among the fauns and rustic bards, had borrowed, or,
if he refused to acknowledge his obligations, had pilfered,
    many ornaments from his predecessor<a id="noteref_141" name="noteref_141" href="#note_141"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">141</span></span></a>. In the same passage,
Cicero, while he admits that Ennius was the more elegant and
correct writer, bears testimony to the merit of the older bard,
and declares, that the Punic war of this antiquated poet afforded
him a pleasure as exquisite as the finest statue that was
ever formed by Myron. To judge, however, from the lines
which remain, though in general too much broken to enable
us even to divine their meaning, the style of Nævius in this
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page63">[pg 63]</span><a name="Pg063" id="Pg063" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>work was more rugged and remote from modern Latin than
that of his own plays and satires, or the dramas of Livius
Andronicus.

The whole, too, is written in the rough, unmodulated, Saturnian
verse—a sort of irregular iambics, said to have been
originally employed by Faunus and the prophets, who delivered
their oracles in this measure. To such rude and unpolished
verses Ennius alludes in a fragment of his Annals,
while explaining his reasons for not treating of the first Punic
war—

As this was the most ancient species of measure employed
in Roman poetry, as it was universally used before the melody
of Greek verse was poured on the Roman ear, and as, from
ancient practice, the same strain continued to be repeated till
the age of Ennius, by whom the heroic measure was introduced,
it would not be suitable to omit some notice of its
origin and structure in an account of Roman literature and
poetry.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Several writers have supposed that the Saturnian measure
    was borrowed by the Romans from the Greeks<a id="noteref_142" name="noteref_142" href="#note_142"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">142</span></span></a>, having been
used by Euripides, and particularly by Archilochus; but
others have believed that it was an invention of the ancient
    Italians<a id="noteref_143" name="noteref_143" href="#note_143"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">143</span></span></a>. It was first employed in the Carmen Saliare, songs
of triumph, supplications to the gods, or monumental inscriptions,
and was afterwards, as we have seen, adopted in the
works of Livius Andronicus and Nævius. In consequence of
the fragments which remain of the Saturnian verses being so
short and corrupted, it is extremely difficult to fix their regular
measure, or reduce them to one standard of versification.
Herman seems to consider a Saturnian line as having
regularly consisted of two iambuses, an amphibrachys, and
three trochaës—

A dactyl, however, was occasionally admitted into the place
of the first or second trochaë, and a spondee was not unfrequently
introduced indiscriminately. It also appears that a

This poet, who has generally received the glorious appellation
of the Father of Roman Song, was a native of Rudiæ, a town
    in Calabria, and lived from the year of Rome 515 to 585<a id="noteref_144" name="noteref_144" href="#note_144"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">144</span></span></a>. In
his early youth he went to Sardinia; and, if Silius Italicus
may be believed, he served in the Calabrian levies, which, in
the year 538, followed Titus Manlius to the war which he
waged in that island against the favourers of the Carthaginian
    cause<a id="noteref_145" name="noteref_145" href="#note_145"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">145</span></span></a>. After the termination of the campaign, he continued

    Sardinia, on returning as <a name="corr064" id="corr064" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">quæstor</span> from Africa<a id="noteref_147" name="noteref_147" href="#note_147"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">147</span></span></a>.

Greek, and acquired the friendship of many of the most illustrious
men in the state. Being distinguished (like Æschylus, the
great father of Grecian tragedy) in arms as well as letters, he
followed M. Fulvius Nobilior during his expedition to Ætolia

It is difficult, however, to see in what expeditions he could

The evils, however, of old age and indigence were supported
by him, as we learn from Cicero, with such patience, and even
cheerfulness, that one would almost have imagined he derived
satisfaction from circumstances which are usually regarded,
    as being, of all others, the most dispiriting and oppressive<a id="noteref_156" name="noteref_156" href="#note_156"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">156</span></span></a>.
The honours due to his character and talents were, as is frequently
the case, reserved till after his death, when a bust of
    him was placed in the family tomb of the Scipios<a id="noteref_157" name="noteref_157" href="#note_157"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">157</span></span></a>, who, till

remained near that sepulchre, beyond the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Porta Capena</span></span>,

The tomb was discovered in 1780, on a farm situated between
the Via Appia and Via Latina. The slabs, which have been
since removed to the Vatican, bear several inscriptions, commemorating
different persons of the Scipian family. Neither
statues, nor any other memorial, then existed of Africanus

To judge by the fragments of his works which remain,
Ennius greatly surpassed his predecessors, not only in poetical
genius, but in the art of versification. By his time, indeed,
the best models of Greek composition had begun to be studied
at Rome. Ennius particularly professed to have imitated
Homer, and tried to persuade his countrymen that the soul
and genius of that great poet had revived in him, through the
medium of a peacock, according to the process of Pythagorean
transmigration. It is to this fantastic genealogy that
Persius has alluded in his 6th satire:—

Accordingly, we find in the fragments of Ennius many imitations
of the Iliad and Odyssey. It is, however, the Greek
tragic writers whom Ennius has chiefly imitated; and indeed
it appears from the fragments which remain, that all his plays
were rather translations from the dramas of Sophocles and
Euripides, on the same subjects which he has chosen, than
original tragedies. They are founded on the old topics of
Priam and Paris, Hector and Hecuba; and truly Ennius, as
well as most other Latin tragedians, seems to have anticipated
Horace’s maxim—

<div class="tei tei-lg" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em; margin-left: 2.00em; margin-top: 1.00em">

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But although it be quite clear that all the plays of Ennius
were translated, or closely imitated, from the Greek, there is
occasionally some difficulty in fixing on the drama which was
followed, and also in ascertaining whether there be any original
passage whatever in the Latin imitation. This difficulty
arises from the practice adopted by the Greek dramatists, of
new modelling their tragedies. Euripides, in particular, sometimes
altered his plays after their first representation, in order
to accommodate them to the circumstances of the times, and
to obviate the sarcastic criticisms of Aristophanes, who had
frequently exposed whole scenes to ridicule. With such
views, considerable changes were made on <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Iphigenia in Aulis</span></span>,
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hippolytus</span></span>, and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Medea</span></span>. Euripides is the author from
whom Ennius has chiefly borrowed the fables of his tragedies;
and when Sophocles and Euripides have treated the same
subject, the latter poet has been uniformly preferred. Not
one of the dramas of Ennius has been imitated from Æschylus.
The reason of this is sufficiently obvious: The plays of
Æschylus have little involution of plot, and are rather what
we should now term dramatic sketches, than tragedies. The
plots of Sophocles are more complex than those of Æschylus;
but the tragedies of Euripides are the most involved of all.
Now, it may be presumed, that a tragedy crowded with action,
and filled with the bustle of a complicated fable, was
best adapted to the taste of the Romans, because we <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">know</span></span>
that this was their taste in comedy. Plautus combined two
Greek comedies to form one Latin; and the representation of
the Hecyra of Terence, the only Latin play formed on the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page68">[pg 68]</span><a name="Pg068" id="Pg068" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>simple Greek model, was repeatedly abandoned by the people
before it was concluded, for the sake of amusements of more
tumult and excitement.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Achilles</span></span>, which, in alphabetical order, is the first of the
plays of Ennius, there are just extant seven lines, which have
been preserved by Nonius and Festus; and from such remains
it is impossible to know what part of the life or actions of the
Grecian hero Ennius had selected as the subject of his plot.
There were many Greek tragedies on the story of Achilles, of
which, one by Aristarchus of Tegea, was the most celebrated,
and is supposed to have been that from which Ennius copied.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ajax</span></span>. Sophocles was author of two tragedies founded on
the events of the life of Ajax;—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ajax Flagellifer</span></span>, and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ajax
Locrensis</span></span>. The first turns on the phrensy with which the
Grecian hero was seized, on being refused the arms of Achilles,
and it may be conjectured, from a single fragment, apparently
at the very close of the tragedy by Ennius, and which
describes the attendants raising the body of Ajax, streaming
with blood, that this was the piece <a name="corr068" id="corr068" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">translated</span> by the Roman
poet.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Alcmæon</span></span>. This play, of which the fable closely resembles
the story of Orestes, has by some been attributed to the Latin
poet Quintus Catulus. The transports of Alcmæon had been
    frequently exhibited on the Greek stage<a id="noteref_164" name="noteref_164" href="#note_164"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">164</span></span></a>. The drama of
Ennius was taken from a tragedy of Euripides, which is now
lost, but its subject is well known from the Thebaid of Statius.
The soothsayer Amphiaraus, foreseeing that he would perish
at the siege of Thebes, concealed himself from the crimps of
those days; but his wife, Eryphile, who alone knew the place
of his retreat, being bribed by the gift of a mantle and necklace,
revealed the secret to one of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Seven before Thebes,”</span>
who compelled him to share in the expedition. Before death,
the prophet enjoined his son, Alcmæon, to avenge him on his
faithless wife. The youth, in compliance with this pious command,
slew his mother, and was afterwards tormented by the
Furies, who would only be appeased by a gift of the whole
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">paraphernalia</span></span> of Eryphile, which were accordingly hung up in
their temple. As soon as their persecution ceased, he married
the fair Calirrhoe, daughter of Achelous, and precipitately
judging that the consecrated necklace would be better bestowed
on his beautiful bride than on the beldame by whom
he had so long been haunted, he contrived, on false pretences,
to purloin it from the place where it was deposited; but the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page69">[pg 69]</span><a name="Pg069" id="Pg069" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Furies were not to be so choused out of their perquisites, and
in consequence of his rash preference, Alcmæon was compelled
to suffer a renewed phrensy, and to undergo a fresh
    course of expiatory ceremonies<a id="noteref_165" name="noteref_165" href="#note_165"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">165</span></span></a>.

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Alexander</span></span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Paris</span></span>). The plot of this play hinges on the
destruction of Troy. The passages which remain are a heavenly
admonition to Priam on the crimes of his son, a lamentation
for the death of Hector, and a prediction of Cassandra
concerning the wooden horse. Planck, in his recent edition
of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Medea</span></span> of Ennius, while he does not deny that our poet
may have written a tragedy with the title of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Alexander</span></span>, is of
opinion that the fragments quoted as from this play in the editions
of Ennius belong properly to his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Alexandra</span></span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cassandra</span></span>),
to which subject they are perfectly applicable. This German
critic has also collected a good many fragments belonging to
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cassandra</span></span>, which had been omitted in Columna and
Merula’s editions of Ennius. The longest of these passages,
delivered by Cassandra in the style of a prophecy, seems to
refer to events previous to the Trojan war—the judgment of
Paris, and arrival of Helen from Sparta.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Andromache</span></span>. It is uncertain from what Greek writer this
tragedy has been translated. It seems to be founded on the
lamentable story of Andromache, who fell, with other Trojan
captives, to the share of Neoptolemus, and saw her only son,
Astyanax, torn from her embraces, to be precipitated from the
summit of a tower, in compliance with the injunctions of an
oracle. Among the fragments of this play, we possess one of
the longest passages extant of the works of Ennius, containing
a pathetic lamentation of Andromache for the fall and conflagration
of Troy, with a comparison between its smoking ruins
and former splendour. This passage Cicero styles, <span class="tei tei-q">“Præclarum

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Andromeda</span></span>. Livius Andronicus had formerly written a
Latin play on the well-known story of Perseus and Andromeda,
which was translated from Sophocles. The play of Ennius,
however, on the same subject, was a version of a tragedy of
Euripides, now chiefly known from the ridicule cast on it in
the fifth act of Aristophanes’ <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Feasts of Ceres</span></span>. That Ennius’
drama was translated from Euripides, is sufficiently manifest,
from a comparison of its fragments with the passages of the

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Erectheus</span></span>. There is just enough of this play extant to have
satisfied Columna, one of the editors of Ennius, that it was
taken from a tragedy of the same name by Euripides. As
told by Hyginus, the fable concerning Erectheus, King of
Attica, was, that he had four daughters, who all pledged
themselves not to survive the death of any one of their number.
Eumolpus, son of Neptune, being slain at the siege of Athens,
his father required that one of the daughters of Erectheus
should be sacrificed to him in compensation. This having
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page71">[pg 71]</span><a name="Pg071" id="Pg071" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>been accomplished, her sisters slew themselves as a matter of
course, and Erectheus was soon afterwards struck by Jupiter
with thunder, at the solicitation of Neptune. The longest

of Polydorus, announcing in great form his arrival from Acheron.

A speech of Hecuba, on seeing the dead body of Polydorus,

of Euripides. On the whole, indeed, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hecuba</span></span> of Ennius
appears, so far as we can judge from the fragments, to be the
least servile of his imitations. In Columna’s edition of Ennius,
an opportunity is afforded by corresponding quotations from
the Greek <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hecuba</span></span>, of comparing the manner in which the

poets. Sophocles had written a tragedy on the topic of the
well-known <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Iphigenia in Aulis</span></span> of Euripides; but it is the latter
piece which has been adopted by the Roman poet.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Boeckius has shown, in a learned dissertation, that Euripides
    wrote two <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Iphigenias in Aulis</span></span><a id="noteref_171" name="noteref_171" href="#note_171"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">171</span></span></a>. From the first, which has
perished, Aristophanes parodied the verses introduced in his
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Frogs</span></span>; and it was on this work that Ennius formed his Latin
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Iphigenia</span></span>. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Iphigenia</span></span> now extant, and published in the
editions of Euripides, is a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">recension</span></span> of the original drama,
which was undertaken on account of the ridicule thrown on

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page73">[pg 73]</span><a name="Pg073" id="Pg073" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>its author. Boeckius, indeed, thinks, that it was written by the
younger Euripides, the nephew of the more celebrated dramatist;
hence some of the lines of Ennius, which, on comparison
with the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Iphigenia</span></span> now extant, appear to us original, were
probably translated from the first written <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Iphigenia</span></span>. Such,
perhaps, are the jingling verses concerning the disadvantages
of idleness, which are supposed, not very naturally, to be sung
while weather-bound in Aulis, by the Greek soldiers, who
form the chorus of this tragedy instead of the women of Chalcis
in the play of Euripides:—

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Medea</span></span>.—This play is imitated from the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Medea</span></span> of Euripides.
    Since the time of Paulus Manutius<a id="noteref_173" name="noteref_173" href="#note_173"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">173</span></span></a>, an idea has prevailed
that Ennius was the author of two plays on the subject of
Medea—one entitled <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Medea</span></span>, and the other <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Medea Exsul</span></span>,
both imitated from Greek originals of Euripides. This opinion
was formed in consequence of there being several passages of
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Medea</span></span> of Ennius, to which corresponding passages cannot
be found in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Medea</span></span> of Euripides, now extant; and it was
confirmed by the grammarians sometimes quoting the play by
the title <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Medea</span></span>, and at others by that of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Medea Exsul</span></span>. Planck,
however, in his recent edition of the fragments of the Latin
tragedy, conjectures that there was only one play, and that
this play was entitled by Ennius the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Medea Exsul</span></span>, which
name was appropriate to the subject; but that when quoted
by the critics and old grammarians, it was sometimes cited,
as was natural, by its full title, at others simply <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Medea</span></span>. The
lines in the Latin play, to which parallel passages cannot be
found in Euripides, he believes to be of Ennius’ own invention.
Osannus thinks, that neither the opinion of Manutius,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page74">[pg 74]</span><a name="Pg074" id="Pg074" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>nor of Planck, is quite accurate. He believes that Euripides
wrote a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Medea</span></span>, which he afterwards revised and altered, in
order to obviate the satiric criticisms of Aristophanes. The
Greek <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Medea</span></span>, which we now have, he supposes to be compounded
of the original copy and the recension,—the ancient
grammarians having interpolated the manuscripts. Ennius,
he maintains, employed the original tragedy; and hence in
the Latin play, we now find translations of lines which were
omitted both in the recension and in the compound tragedy,
    which is at present extant<a id="noteref_174" name="noteref_174" href="#note_174"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">174</span></span></a>.

The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Medea</span></span> of Ennius was a popular drama at Rome, and
was considered one of the best productions of its author.
Cicero asks, if there be any one such a foe to the Roman
name, as to reject or despise the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Medea</span></span> of Ennius. From the
romantic interest of the subject, Medea was the heroine of not
less than four epic poems; and no fable, of Greek antiquity,
was more frequently dramatized by the Latin poets. Attius,
Varro, Ovid, and Seneca, successively imitated the tragedy of
Ennius, and improved on their model.

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phœnix</span></span>.—There were two persons of this name in mythological
story. One the son of Agenor, and brother of Cadmus,
who gave name to Phœnicia; the other the preceptor of
Achilles, who accompanied that hero to the Trojan war. The
only reason for supposing that the tragedy of Ennius related
to this latter person is, that a play founded on some part of
his life was written by Euripides, from whom the Roman poet
has borrowed so much.

of Telamon, particularly the concluding period of his
life, in which he heard of the death of his eldest son Ajax,
and the exile of his second son Teucer. To judge from the
fragments which remain, it must have been by far the finest
drama of Ennius. He thus happily versifies the celebrated
sentiment of Anaxagoras, and puts it into the mouth of Telamon,
when he hears of the death of his son—

ridiculed by Aristophanes in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Acharnenses</span></span>, from a scene of
which it would seem that Telephus had appeared on the stage
in tattered garments. The passages of the Latin play which
remain, exhibit Telephus as an exile from his kingdom, wandering
about in ragged habiliments. The lines of Horace, in
his Art of Poetry, (a work which is devoted to the subject of
the Roman drama,) are probably in allusion to this tragedy:

accordingly has been censured by Cicero, in a passage of his

Yet this spiritless tragedy, was very popular in Rome, and
continued to be frequently represented, till Varius treated the
same subject in a manner, as we are informed by Quintilian,
    equal to the Greeks<a id="noteref_178" name="noteref_178" href="#note_178"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">178</span></span></a>.

It thus appears that Ennius has little claim to originality or
invention as a tragic author. Perhaps it may seem remarkable,
that a poet of his powerful genius did not rather write
new plays, than copy servilely from the Greeks. But nothing
is ever invented where borrowing will as well serve the purpose.
Rome had few artists, in consequence of the facility with which
the finest specimens of the arts were procured by plundering
the towns of Sicily and Greece. Now, at the period in which
Ennius flourished, the productions of Grecian literature were
almost as new to the Romans as the most perfectly original
compositions. Thus, the dramatic works of Ennius were
possessed of equal novelty for his audience as if wholly his
own; while a great deal of trouble was saved to himself. The
example, however, was unfortunate, as it communicated to
Roman literature a character of servility, and of imitation, or
rather of translation, from the Greek, which so completely
pervaded it, that succeeding poets were most faultless when
they copied most closely, and at length, when they abandoned
the guides whom they had so long followed, they fell into
declamation and bombast. Probably, had the compositions of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page77">[pg 77]</span><a name="Pg077" id="Pg077" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Ennius been original, they would have been less perfect, than
by being thus imitated, or nearly translated, from the masterpieces
of Greece. But the literature of his country might
ultimately have attained a higher eminence. The imitative
productions of Ennius may be likened to those trees which are
transplanted when far advanced in growth. Much at first
appears to have been gained; but it is certain, that he who
sets the seedling is more useful than the transplanter, and
that, while the trees removed from their native soil lose their
original beauty and luxuriance without increase in magnitude,
the seedling swells in its parent earth to immensity of size—fresh,
blooming, and verdant in youth, vigorous in maturity,
and venerable in old age.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Nor, although Ennius was the first writer who introduced
satiric composition into Rome, are his pretensions, in this
respect, to originality, very distinguished. He adapted the
ancient satires of the Tuscan and Oscan stage to the closet,
by refining their grossness, softening their asperity, and introducing
railleries borrowed from the Greek poets, with whom
he was familiar. His satires thus appear to have been a
species of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">centos</span></span> made up from passages of various poems,
which, by slight alterations, were humorously or satirically applied,
and chiefly to the delineation of character: <span class="tei tei-q">“Carmen,”</span>
says Diomedes the grammarian, <span class="tei tei-q">“quod ex variis poematibus constabat
satira vocabatur, quale scripserunt Pacuvius et Ennius.”</span>
The fragments which remain of these satires are too short and
broken to allow us even to divine their subject. That entitled
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Asotus</span></span> vel <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sotadicus</span></span>, is the representation of a luxurious,
dissolute man, and was so termed from Sotades, a voluptuous
Cretan poet. Quintilian also mentions, that one of his satires
contained a Dialogue between Life and Death, contending
with each other, a mode of composition suggested perhaps by
the celebrated allegory of Prodicus. We are farther informed
by Aulus Gellius, that he introduced into another satire, with
    great skill and beauty, Æsop’s fable of the Larks<a id="noteref_179" name="noteref_179" href="#note_179"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">179</span></span></a>, now well
    known through the imitation of Fontaine<a id="noteref_180" name="noteref_180" href="#note_180"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">180</span></span></a>. The lark having
built her nest among some early corn, feared that it might be
reaped before her young ones were fit to take wing. She
therefore desired them to report to her whatever conversation
they might hear in the fields during her absence. They first
informed her, that the husbandman had come to the spot, and
desired his son to summon their neighbours and friends to
assist in cutting the crop the next morning. The lark, on
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page78">[pg 78]</span><a name="Pg078" id="Pg078" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>hearing this, declares, that there is no occasion to be in any
haste in removing. On the following day, it is again reported,
that the husbandman had desired that his relations should be
requested to assist him; and the lark is still of opinion that
there is no necessity to hurry away. At length, however, the
young larks relate, that the husbandman had announced that
he would execute the work himself. On hearing this, the old
lark said it was now time to be gone. She accordingly removed
her younglings, and the corn was immediately cut
down by the master. From this tale Ennius deduces as the
moral,

It is certainly much to be regretted that we possess so
scanty fragments of these satires, which would have been

was carried to such perfection by succeeding Latin poets, and

The great work, however, of Ennius, and of which we have
still considerable remains, was his Annals, or metrical chronicles,
devoted to the celebration of Roman exploits, from the
earliest periods to the conclusion of the Istrian war. These
Annals were written by our poet in his old age; at least,
Aulus Gellius informs us, on the authority of Varro, that the
    twelfth book was finished by him in his sixty-seventh year<a id="noteref_181" name="noteref_181" href="#note_181"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">181</span></span></a>.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It may perhaps appear strange, that, when the fabulous
exploits, the superstitions, the characters and the manners, of
the heroic ages, were so admirably adapted for poetical
imagery, and had been so successfully employed in Greece,
the chief work of the Father of Roman Song should have been
a sort of versified newspaper, like the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Henriade</span></span> of Voltaire,
or the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Araucana</span></span> of Alonco de Ercilla: For in other countries
poetry has been earliest devoted to the decoration of those
marvels in which the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">amantes mira Camœnæ</span></span> chiefly rejoice.
In most lands, however, the origin of poetry was coeval with
the rise of the nation, and every thing seems wondrous to an
ignorant and timid race. The Greeks, in their first poetical
age, peopled every grove and lake with fauns and naiads, or
personified the primeval powers of nature. They sung the
fables concerning their gods, and the exploits of heroes, in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page79">[pg 79]</span><a name="Pg079" id="Pg079" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>those ancient verses which have been combined in the Theogony
attributed to Hesiod, and those immortal rhapsodies
which have formed the basis of the Homeric poems. The
marvellous vision of Dante was the earliest effort of the Italian
muse; and some of the first specimens of verse in France and
England were wild adventures in love or arms, interspersed
with stories of demons and enchanters. But in Rome, though
the first effort of the language was in poetry, five hundred
years had elapsed from the foundation of the city before this
effort was made. At that period, the Romans were a rude
but rational race. The locks of Curius were perhaps uncombed;
but though the Republic had as yet produced no
character of literary elegance, she had given birth to Cincinnatus,
and Fabricius, and Camillus. Her citizens had neither
been rendered timid nor indolent by their superstitions, but
were actively employed in agriculture or in arms. They were
a less contemplative and imaginative race than the Greeks.
Their spirit was indeed sufficiently warlike; but that peculiar
spirit of adventure, (which characterised the early ages of
Greece, and the middle ages of modern Europe,) had, if it
ever existed, long ago ceased in Rome. By this time, the
Roman armies were too well disciplined, and the system of
warfare too regular, to admit a description of the picturesque
combats of the Greek and Trojan charioteers. Poetry was
thus too late in its birth to take a natural flight. In such
circumstances, the bard, however rich or lofty might be his
conceptions, would not listen to his own taste or inspiration,
but select the theme which was likely to prove most popular;
and the Romans, being a national and ambitious people,
would be more gratified by the jejune relation of their own
exploits, than by the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">speciosa miracula</span></span> of the most sublime
or romantic invention.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Annals of Ennius were partly founded on those ancient
traditions and old heroic ballads, which Cicero, on the authority
of Cato’s <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Origines</span></span>, mentions as having been sung at
feasts by the guests, many centuries before the age of Cato,
    in praise of the heroes of Rome<a id="noteref_182" name="noteref_182" href="#note_182"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">182</span></span></a>. Niebuhr has attempted to
show, that all the memorable events of Roman history had
been versified in ballads, or metrical chronicles, in the Saturnian
measure, before the time of Ennius; who, according to
him, merely expressed in the Greek hexameter, what his predecessors
had delivered in a ruder strain, and then maliciously
depreciated these ancient compositions, in order that he himself
    might be considered as the founder of Roman poetry<a id="noteref_183" name="noteref_183" href="#note_183"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">183</span></span></a>.

stories of Scævola, Cocles, and Coriolanus,—Niebuhr believes
to have been the subjects of romantic ballads. Even
Fabius Pictor, according to this author, followed one of these
old legends in his narrative concerning Mars and the Wolf,
and his whole history of Romulus. Livy, too, in his account
of the death of Lucretia, has actually transcribed from one of
these productions; since what Sextus says, on entering the
chamber of Lucretia, is nearly in the Saturnian measure:—

But the chief work, according to Niebuhr, from which Ennius
borrowed, was a romantic epopee, or chronicle, made up from
these heroic ballads about the end of the fourth century of
Rome, commencing with the accession of Tarquinius Priscus,
and ending with the battle of Regillus. The arrival, says
Niebuhr, of that monarch under the name of Lucumo—his
exploits and victories—his death—then the history of Servius
Tullius—the outrageous pride of Tullia—the murder of the
lawful monarch—the fall of the last Tarquin, preceded by a
supernatural warning—Lucretia—Brutus and the truly Homeric
battle of Regillus—compose an epic, which, in poetical
incident, and splendour of fancy, surpasses everything produced
    in the latter ages of Rome<a id="noteref_185" name="noteref_185" href="#note_185"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">185</span></span></a>. The battle of Regillus,
in particular, as described by the annalists, bears evident
marks of its poetical origin. It was not a battle between two
hosts, but a struggle of heroes. As in the fights painted in
the Iliad, the champions meet in single combat, and turn by
individual exertions the tide of victory. The dictator Posthumius
wounds King Tarquin, whom he had encountered at the
first onset. The Roman knight Albutius engages with the
Latin chief Mamilius, but is wounded by him, and forced to
quit the field. Mamilius then nearly breaks the Roman line,
but is slain by the Consul Herminius, which decides the fate of
the day. After the battle of Regillus, all the events are not so
completely poetical; but in the siege of Veii we have a representation
of the ten years war of Troy. The secret introduction
of the troops by Camillus into the middle of the city resembles
the story of the wooden horse, and the Etruscan statue
    of Juno corresponds to the Trojan Palladium<a id="noteref_186" name="noteref_186" href="#note_186"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">186</span></span></a>.

Any period of history may be thus exhibited in the form of
an epic cycle; and, though there can be little doubt of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page81">[pg 81]</span><a name="Pg081" id="Pg081" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>existence of ancient Saturnian ballads at Rome, I do not think
that Niebuhr has adduced sufficient proof or authority for his
magnificent epopee, commencing with the accession of Tarquin,
and ending with the battle of Regillus. With regard
to the accusation against Ennius, of depreciating the ancient
materials which he had employed, it is founded on the contempt
which he expresses for the verses of the Fauns and the
Prophets. His obligations, if he owed any, he has certainly
nowhere acknowledged, at least in the fragments which remain;
and he rather betrays an anxiety, at the commencement of his
poem, to carry away the attention of the reader from the Saturnian
muses, and direct it to the Grecian poets,—to Pindus,
and the nymphs of Helicon.

to the first Carthaginian war, particularly the description of
naval preparations, and the building of the first fleet with
which the Carthaginians were attacked by the Romans. In

The eighth and ninth books of these Annals, which are much
mutilated, detailed the events of the second Carthaginian war
in Italy and Africa. This was by much the most interesting
part of the copious subject which Ennius had chosen, and a
portion of it on which he would probably exert all the force of
his genius, in order the more to honour his friend and patron
Scipio Africanus. The same topic was selected by Silius
Italicus, and by Petrarch for his Latin poem <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Africa</span></span>, which obtained
him a coronation in the Capitol. <span class="tei tei-q">“Ennius,”</span> says the
illustrious Italian, <span class="tei tei-q">“has sung fully of Scipio; but, in the opinion
of Valerius Maximus, his style is harsh and vulgar, and
there is yet no elegant poem which has for its subject the glorious
exploits of the conqueror of Hannibal.”</span> None of the
poets who have chosen this topic, have done full justice to
the most arduous struggle in which two powerful nations had
ever engaged, and which presented the most splendid display
of military genius on the one hand, and heroic virtue on the
other, that had yet been exhibited to the world. Livy’s histo<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page85">[pg 85]</span><a name="Pg085" id="Pg085" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>rical account of the second Punic war possesses more real

it may be interesting to compare a passage produced
in the extreme old age of Roman literature, which also paints,
by nearly the same images, the profound repose of Nature:—

The historical poems of Ennius appear to have been written
without the introduction of much machinery or decorative fiction; 
and whether founded on ancient ballads, according to
    one opinion<a id="noteref_199" name="noteref_199" href="#note_199"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">199</span></span></a>, or framed conformably to historical truth, according
    to another<a id="noteref_200" name="noteref_200" href="#note_200"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">200</span></span></a>, they were obviously deficient in those
embellishments of imagination which form the distinction between
a poem and a metrical chronicle. In the subject which
he had chosen, Ennius wanted the poetic advantages of distance
in place or of time. It perhaps matters little whether
the ground-work of a heroic poem be historical or entirely
fictitious, if free scope be given for the excursions of fancy.
But, in order that it may sport with advantage, the event must
be remote in time or in place; and if this rule be observed,
such subjects as those chosen by Camoens or Tasso admit of
as much colouring and embellishment as the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Faery Queen</span></span>. It
is in this that Lucan and Voltaire have erred; and neither the
soaring genius of the one, nor brilliancy of the other, could
raise their themes, splendid as they were, from the dust, or
steep the mind in those reveries in which we indulge on subjects
where there is no visible or known bound to credulity
and imaginings. Still the Annals of Ennius, as a national
work, were highly gratifying to a proud ambitious people, and,
in consequence, continued long popular at Rome. They were
highly relished in the age of Horace and Virgil; and, as far
down as the time of Marcus Aurelius, they were recited in
theatres and other public places for the amusement of the
    people<a id="noteref_201" name="noteref_201" href="#note_201"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">201</span></span></a>. The Romans, indeed, were so formed on his style,
that Seneca called them <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">populus Ennianus</span></span>—an Ennian race,—and 
said, that both Cicero and Virgil were obliged, contrary
to their own judgment, to employ antiquated terms, in
    compliance with the reigning prejudice<a id="noteref_202" name="noteref_202" href="#note_202"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">202</span></span></a>. From his example,
too, added to the national character, the historical epic became
in future times the great poetical resource of the Romans,
who versified almost every important event in their history.
Besides the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pharsalia</span></span> of Lucan, and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Punica</span></span> of Silius Italicus,
which still survive, there were many works of this description
which are now lost. Varro <a name="corr087a" id="corr087a" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">Atacinus</span> chose as his subject
Cæsar’s war with the Sequani—Varius, the deeds of Augustus
and Agrippa—Valgius Rufus, the battle of Actium—Albinovanus,
the exploits of Germanicus—Cicero, those of Marius,
and the events of his own consulship.

We have already seen Ennius’s imitation of the Greeks in
his tragedies and satires; and even in the above-mentioned
historical poems, though devoted to the celebration of Roman
heroes and subjects exclusively national, he has borrowed
copiously from the Greek poets, and has often made his Roman
consuls fight over again the Homeric battles. Thus the description
of the combat of Ajax, in the 16th Book of the Iliad,
beginning <span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-family: Gentium, 'New Athena Unicode', 'DejaVu Serif', 'Lucida Grande', 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Palatino Linotype', serif">Αιας δ’ ουκετ’ ἐμιμνε</span></span>, has suggested a passage, above

from the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Apologia</span></span> of Apuleius. It was, which its name imports,
a didactic poem on eatables, particularly fish, as Apuleius

translated from Timæus the Locrian. This was the same
Epicharmus who invented Greek comedy, and resided in the

Ennius are so broken and corrupted, that it is impossible to
follow the plan of his poem, or to discover the system of philosophy
which it inculcated. It appears, however, to have
contained many speculations concerning the elements of which
the world was primarily composed, and which, according to

himself of these writings than Virgil has profited by the works

In the longer passages, Virgil has not merely selected the
happiest thoughts and expressions of his predecessor, but in
borrowing a great deal from Ennius, he has added much of
his own. He has thrown on common images new lights of
fancy; he has struck out the finest ideas from ordinary sentiments,
and expunged all puerile conceits and absurdities.

Thus it appears that Ennius occasionally produced verses
of considerable harmony and beauty, and that his conceptions
were frequently expressed with energy and spirit. It must be
recollected, however, that the lines imitated by Virgil, and
the other passages which have been here extracted from the
works of Ennius, are very favourable specimens of his taste
and genius. Sometimes poems, which have themselves been
lost, and of which only fragments are preserved, in the citations
of contemporary or succeeding authors, are now believed
to have been finer productions than they perhaps actually
were. It is the best passages which are quoted, and imitated,
and are thus upborne on the tide of ages, while the grosser
parts have sunk and perished in the flood. We are in this
manner led to form an undue estimate of the excellence of

Palmyra, where, while the humble dwellings have mouldered
into dust, the temples and pyramids remain, and all that meets

This species of conceit was rejected by the good taste of subsequent
Latin poets, even in the most degraded periods of
literature; and I know no parallel to it, except in some passages
of Sidney’s Arcadia. Nothing can be a greater mistake,

latter ages of poetry, and that the early bards of a country
are free from <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">concetti</span></span>.

happily enough compared the writings of Ennius to those
sacred groves hallowed by their antiquity, and which we do
not so much admire for their beauty, as revere with religious

But whatever may have been the merits of the works of Ennius,
of which we are now but incompetent judges, they were at
least sufficiently various. Epic, dramatic, satiric, and didactic
poetry, were all successively attempted by him; and we also
learn that he exercised himself in lighter sorts of verse, as the
    epigram and acrostic<a id="noteref_218" name="noteref_218" href="#note_218"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">218</span></span></a>. For this novelty and exuberance it is
not difficult to account. The fountains of Greek literature, as
yet untasted in Latium, were to him inexhaustible sources.
He stood in very different circumstances from those Greek
bards who had to rely solely on their own genius, or from his
successors in Latin poetry, who wrote after the best productions
of Greece had become familiar to the Romans. He was
placed in a situation in which he could enjoy all the popularity
and applause due to originality, without undergoing the labour
of invention, and might rapidly run with success through every
mode of the lyre, without possessing incredible diversity of
genius.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The above criticisms apply to the poetical productions of
Ennius; but the most curious point connected with his literary
history is his prose translation of the celebrated work of
Euhemerus, entitled, <span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-family: Gentium, 'New Athena Unicode', 'DejaVu Serif', 'Lucida Grande', 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Palatino Linotype', serif">Ἱερα Αναγραφη</span></span>. Euhemerus is generally
supposed to have been an inhabitant of Messene, a city of
Peloponnesus. Being sent, as he represented, on a voyage of
discovery by Cassander, King of Macedon, he came to an
island called Panchaia, in the capital of which, Panara, he
found a temple of the Tryphilian Jupiter, where stood a column
inscribed with a register of the births and deaths of many
of the gods. Among these, he specified Uranus, his sons Pan
and Saturn, and his daughters Rhea and Ceres; as also Jupiter,
Juno, and Neptune, who were the offspring of Saturn. Ac<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page95">[pg 95]</span><a name="Pg095" id="Pg095" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>cordingly, the design of Euhemerus was to show, by investigating
their actions, and recording the places of their births
and burials, that the mythological deities were mere mortal
men, raised to the rank of gods on account of the benefits
which they had conferred on mankind,—a system which, according
to Meiners and Warburton, formed the grand secret
    revealed at the initiation into the Eleusinian mysteries<a id="noteref_219" name="noteref_219" href="#note_219"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">219</span></span></a>. The
translation by Ennius, as well as the original work, is lost; but
many particulars concerning Euhemerus, and the object of his
history, are mentioned in a fragment of Diodorus Siculus,
preserved by Eusebius. Some passages have also been saved
by St. Augustine; and long quotations, have been made by
Lactantius, in his treatise <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De Falsa Religione</span></span>. These, so far
as they extend, may be regarded as the truest and purest
sources of mythological history, though not much followed in
our modern <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pantheons</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Plutarch, who was associated to the priesthood, and all who
were interested in the support of the vulgar creed, maintained,
that the whole work of Euhemerus, with his voyage to Panchaia,
was an impudent fiction; and, in particular, it was
urged, that no one except Euhemerus had ever seen or heard
    of the land of Panchaia<a id="noteref_220" name="noteref_220" href="#note_220"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">220</span></span></a>: that the Panchaia Tellus had
indeed been described in a flowery and poetical style, both by
Diodorus Siculus and Virgil—

but not in such a manner as to determine its geographical
position.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The truth, however, of the relation contained in the work
of Euhemerus, has been vindicated by modern writers; who
have attempted to prove that Panchaia was an island of the
Red Sea, which Euhemerus had actually visited in the course
    of his voyage<a id="noteref_222" name="noteref_222" href="#note_222"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">222</span></span></a>. But whether Euhemerus merely recorded
what he had seen, or whether the whole book was a device
and contrivance of his own, it seems highly probable that the
translation of Ennius gave rise to the belief of many Roman
philosophers, who maintained, or insinuated, their conviction
of the mortality of the gods, and whose writings have been so
frequently appealed to by Farmer, in his able disquisition on
the prevalence of the Worship of Human Spirits.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is clear, that notwithstanding their observance of prodigies
and religious ceremonies, there prevailed a considerable
spirit of free-thinking among the Romans in the age of Ennius.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page96">[pg 96]</span><a name="Pg096" id="Pg096" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>This is apparent, not merely from his translation of Euhemerus,
and definition of the nature of Jupiter, in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Epicharmus</span></span>,
but from various passages in dramas adapted for public representation,
which deride the superstitions of augurs and soothsayers,
as well as the false ideas entertained of the worshipped
divinities. Polybius, too, who flourished shortly after Ennius,
speaks of the fear of the gods, and the inventions of augury,
merely as an excellent political engine, at the same time that
he reprehends the rashness and absurdity of those who were
    endeavouring to extirpate such useful opinions<a id="noteref_223" name="noteref_223" href="#note_223"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">223</span></span></a>.

who availed himself, still more even than his predecessors, of
the works of the Greeks. The Old Greek comedy was excessively
satirical, and sometimes obscene. Its subjects, as is
well known, were not entirely fictitious, but in a great measure
real; and neither the highest station, nor the brightest talents,
were any security against the unrestrained invectives of the
comic muse in her earliest sallies. Cratinus, Eupolis, and
Aristophanes, were permitted to introduce on the stage the
philosophers, generals, and magistrates of the state with their
true countenances, and as it were in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">propria persona</span></span>; a license
which seems, in some measure, to have been regarded as the
badge of popular freedom. It is only from the plays of Aristophanes
that we can judge of the spirit of the ancient comedy.
Its genius was so wild and strange, that it scarcely admits of
definition: and can hardly be otherwise described, than as
containing a great deal of allegorical satire on the political
measures and manners of the Athenians, and parodies on their
tragic poets.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When in Athens the people began to lose their political
influence, and when the management of their affairs was vested
in fewer hands than formerly, the oligarchical government
restrained this excessive license; but while the poets were
prohibited from naming the individuals whose actions they
exposed, still they represented real characters so justly, though
under fictitious appellations, that there could be no mistake
with regard to the persons intended. This species of drama,
which <a name="corr096" id="corr096" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">comprehends</span> some of the later pieces of Aristophanes,—for
example, his Plutus,—and is named the Middle comedy,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page97">[pg 97]</span><a name="Pg097" id="Pg097" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>was soon discovered to be as offensive and dangerous as the
old. The dramatists being thus at length forced to invent
their subjects and characters, comedy became a general yet
lively imitation of the common actions of life. All personal
allusion was dropped, and the Chorus, which had been the
great vehicle of censure and satire, was removed. The new
comedy was thus so different in its features from the middle
or the old, that Schlegel has been induced to think, that it
was formed on the model of the latest tragedians, rather than
    on the ancient comedy<a id="noteref_224" name="noteref_224" href="#note_224"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">224</span></span></a>. In the productions of Agathon, and
even in some dramas of Euripides, tragedy had descended
from its primeval height, and represented the distresses of
domestic life, though still the domestic life of kings and
heroes. Though Euripides was justly styled by Aristotle the
most tragic of all poets, his style possessed neither the energy
and sublimity of Æschylus, nor the gravity and stateliness of
Sophocles, and it was frequently not much elevated above the
language of ordinary conversation. His plots, too, like the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rudens</span></span> of Plautus, often hinge on the fear of women, lest
they be torn from the shrines or altars to which they had fled
for protection; and what may be regarded as a confirmation
of this opinion is, that Euripides, who had been so severely
satirized by Aristophanes, was extravagantly extolled by Philemon,
in his own age the most popular writer of the new
comedy.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
While possessing, perhaps, both less art and fire than the
old satirical drama, produced in times of greater public freedom,
the new comedy is generally reputed to have been superior
in delicacy, regularity, and decorum. But although it
represented the characters and manners of real life, yet in
these characters and manners—to judge at least from the
fragments which remain, and from the Latin imitations—there
does not appear to have been much variety. There is always
an old father, a lover, and a courtezan; as if formed on each
other, like the Platonic and licentious lover in the Spanish
romances of chivalry. <span class="tei tei-q">“Their plots,”</span> says Dryden, <span class="tei tei-q">“were
commonly a little girl, stolen or wandering from her parents,
brought back unknown to the city,—there got with child by
some one, who, by the help of his servant, cheats his father,—and
when her time comes to cry Juno Lucina, one or other
sees a little box or cabinet which was carried away with her,
and so discovers her to her friends;—if some god do not prevent
it, by coming down in a machine, and taking the thanks
of it to himself. By the plot you may guess much of the cha<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page98">[pg 98]</span><a name="Pg098" id="Pg098" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>racters of the persons; an old father, who would willingly
before he dies see his son well married; a debauched son,
kind in his nature to his mistress, but miserably in want of
money; and a servant, or slave, who has so much art as to
strike in with him, and help to dupe his father; a braggadocio
captain; a parasite; a lady of pleasure. As for the poor
honest maid, on whom the story is built, and who ought to be
one of the principal actors in the play, she is commonly mute
in it. She has the breeding of the old Elizabeth way: which
was, for maids to be seen and not to be heard.”</span> Sometimes,
however, her breeding appears in being heard and not seen;
and Donatus remarks, that invocations of Juno behind the
scenes were the only way in which the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">severity</span></span> of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Comœdia
palliata</span></span> allowed young gentlewomen to be introduced.
Were we to characterize the ancient drama by appellations of
modern invention, it might be said, that the ancient comedy
was what we call a comedy of character, and the modern a
comedy of intrigue.

Nævius, while inventing plots of his own, had tried to
introduce on the Roman stage the style of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">old</span></span> Greek comedy;
but his dramas did not succeed, and the fate of their
author deterred others from following his dangerous career. The
government of Athens, which occupies a chief part in the old
comedy, was the most popular of all administrations; and hence
not only oratory but comedy claimed the right of ridiculing and
exposing it. The first state in Greece became the subject of
merriment. In one play, the whole body of the people was
represented under the allegorical personage of an old doting
driveller; and the pleasantry was not only tolerated but enjoyed
by the members of the state itself. Cleon and Lamachus
could not have repressed the satire of Aristophanes, as
the Metelli checked the invectives of Nævius. Under pretence
of patriotic zeal, the Greek comic writers spared no part of the
public conduct,—councils, revenues, popular assemblies, judicial
proceedings, or warlike enterprizes. Such exposure was
a restraint on the ambition of individuals,—a matter of importance
to a people jealous of its liberties. All this, however,
was quite foreign to the more serious taste, and more aristocratic
government, of the Romans, to their estimation of
heroes and statesmen, to their respect for their legitimate
chiefs, and for the dignity even of a Roman citizen. The profound
reverence and proud affection which they entertained
for all that exalted the honour of their country, and their extreme
sensibility to its slightest disgrace, must have interdicted
any exhibition, in which its glory was humbled, or its misfortunes
held up to mockery. They would not have laughed so
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page99">[pg 99]</span><a name="Pg099" id="Pg099" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>heartily at the disasters of a Carthaginian, as the Athenians
did at those of a Peloponnesian or Sicilian war. The disposition
which led them to return thanks to Varro, after the battle
of Cannæ, that he had not despaired of the republic, was
very different from the temper which excited such contumelious
laughter at the promoters of the Spartan war, and the
    advisers of the fatal expedition to Syracuse<a id="noteref_225" name="noteref_225" href="#note_225"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">225</span></span></a>. When the
Roman people were seriously offended, the Tarpeian rock,
and not the stage, was the spot selected for their vengeance.

Accordingly, Plautus found it most prudent to imitate the
style of the new comedy, which had been brought to perfection,
about half a century before his birth, by Menander. All
his comedies, however, are not strictly formed on this model,
as a few partake of the nature of the middle comedy: not that,
like Nævius, he satirized the senators or consuls; but I have
little doubt that many of his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">dramatis personæ</span></span>, such as the
miser and braggart captain, were originally caricatures of
citizens of Athens. In borrowing from the Greek, he did not,
like modern writers of comedy who wish to conceal their plagiarisms,
vary the names of his characters, the scene of action,
and other external circumstances, while the substance of the
drama remained the same; on the contrary, he preserved every
circumstance which could tend to give his dramatic pieces a
Greek air:—

Plautus was the son of a freedman, and was born at Sarsina,
a town in Umbria, about the year 525. He was called Plautus
from his splay feet, a defect common among the Umbrians.
Having turned his attention to the stage, he soon realized a
considerable fortune by the popularity of his dramas; but by
risking it in trade, or spending it, according others, on the
splendid dresses which he wore as an actor, and theatrical
amusements being little resorted to, on account of the famine
then prevailing at Rome, he was quickly reduced to such
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page100">[pg 100]</span><a name="Pg100" id="Pg100" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>necessity as forced him to labour at a hand-mill for his daily

punishment of a worthless slave. Many of his plays were
written in these unfavourable circumstances, and of course
have not obtained all the perfection which might otherwise
have resulted from his knowledge of life, and his long practice

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Amphitryon</span></span>.—Personal resemblances are a most fertile
subject of comic incidents, and almost all nations have had
their Amphitryon. The Athenians in particular gladly availed
themselves of this subject, as it afforded an opportunity of
throwing ridicule on the dull Bœotians. It is not certain, however,
from what Greek author the play of Plautus was taken.
    Being announced as a tragi-comedy, some critics<a id="noteref_227" name="noteref_227" href="#note_227"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">227</span></span></a> have
conjectured that it was most probably imitated from an Amphitryon
    mentioned by Athenæus,<a id="noteref_228" name="noteref_228" href="#note_228"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">228</span></span></a> which was the work of
Rhinton, a poet of Tarentum, who wrote mock-tragedies and
tragi-comedies styled <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rhintonica</span></span> or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hilarotragœdiæ</span></span>. M.
Schlegel, however, alleges that it was borrowed from a play
of Epicharmus the Sicilian. The subjects indeed of the ancient
Greek comedy, particularly in the hands of Epicharmus,
its inventor, were frequently derived from mythology. Even
in its maturity, these topics were not renounced, as appears
from the titles of several lost pieces of Aristophanes and his
contemporaries. Such fabulous traditions continued sometimes
to occupy the scenes of the middle comedy, and it was
not till the new was introduced that the sphere of the comic
drama was confined to the representation of private and domestic
life. Euripides also is said to have written a play
entitled <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Alcmena</span></span>, on the story of Amphitryon, but how far
Plautus may have been indebted to him for his plot cannot be
now ascertained. It is probable enough, however, that some
of the serious parts may have been copied from the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Alcmena</span></span> 
of Euripides. The catastrophe of Plautus’s <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Amphitryon</span></span> is
brought about by a storm; and we learn from the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rudens</span></span>,
another play of Plautus, that a tempest was introduced by the
Greek tragedian—

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Latin play is introduced by a prologue which is spoken
by the God Mercury, and was explanatory to the audience of
the circumstances preceding the opening of the piece, and the
situation of the principal characters. The term <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">prologue</span></span> has
been very arbitrarily used. In one sense it merely signified
the induction to the dramatic action, which informed the
spectator of what was necessary to be known for duly understanding
it. Aristotle calls that part of a tragedy the prologue,
    which precedes the first song of the chorus.<a id="noteref_229" name="noteref_229" href="#note_229"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">229</span></span></a> In the Greek
tragedies, the prologue was often a long introductory and
narrative monologue. Sophocles, however, so <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">dialogued</span></span> this
part of the drama, that it has no appearance of a contrivance
to instruct, but seems a natural conversation of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">dramatis
personæ</span></span>. Euripides, on the other hand, fell more into the
style of the formal narrative prologue, since, before entering
on the action or dialogue, one of the persons destined to bear
a part in the drama frequently explained to the audience, in
a continued discourse, what things seemed essential for understanding
the piece. Sometimes, however, in the Greek tragedies,
the speaker of this species of prologue is not a person
of the drama. In general, these artificial prologues of explanatory
narration are addressed directly to the spectators, and
hence approach nearly to the prologue, in our acceptation of
the term. The poets of the ancient comedy, as we see from
Aristophanes, usually adopted, like Sophocles, the mode of
explaining preliminary circumstances in the course of the
action, whence it has been considered that the old Greek
comedies have no prologue; and they certainly have none in
the strict modern sense, though the method of Euripides has
been employed to a certain degree in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Wasps</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Birds</span></span>,
in the former of which Xanthias, interrupting the dialogue
with Sosias, turns abruptly to the spectators, and unfolds the
argument of the fable. The poets of the middle and new
comedy, while departing from Aristophanes in many things,
followed him in the form of the prologue; and, as they improved
in refinement, interwove still closer the requisite exposition
of the fable with its action. The Romans thus found
among the Greeks, prologues in a continued narrative, <a name="corr101" id="corr101" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">and</span>
prologues where the exposition was mixed with the action.
From these models they formed a new species, peculiar to
themselves, which is entirely separated from the action of the
drama, and which generally contains an explanation of circumstances
and characters, with such gentle recommendation
of the piece as suited the purpose of the author. We shall
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page102">[pg 102]</span><a name="Pg102" id="Pg102" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>find that the Latin prologues, dressed up in the form of narrative,
sometimes preceded the dramatic induction of the
action, and at other times, as in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Miles Gloriosus</span></span>, followed
it. The prologue of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Mostellaria</span></span> is on the plan adopted
by Aristophanes, and that of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cistellaria</span></span> is conformable to
the practice of our own theatre. To other plays, such as the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Epidicus</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bacchides</span></span>, there were originally no prologues,
but they were prefixed after the death of the author, in order
to explain the reasons for bringing them forward anew. It
thus appears that in his prologues Plautus approached nearer
to Euripides than to those comic writers whom in his argument
and all other respects he chiefly followed. The prologues
of Terence, again, seldom announce the subject. In
the manner of the Greeks, his induction is laid in the first
scene of the play, and the prologues seem chiefly intended to
acknowledge the Greek original of his drama, and to explain
matters personal to himself. They rather resemble the choruses
of Aristophanes, which in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Wasps</span></span> and other plays
directly address the audience in favour of the poet, and complain
of the unjust reception which his dramas occasionally
experienced.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the prologue to the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Amphitryon</span></span>, Plautus calls his play
    a tragi-comedy<a id="noteref_230" name="noteref_230" href="#note_230"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">230</span></span></a>; probably not so much that there is any
thing tragical in the subject, (although the character of Alcmena
is a serious one,) as, because it is of that mixed kind in
which the highest as well as lowest characters are introduced.
The plot is chiefly founded on the well-known mythological
incident of Jupiter assuming the figure of Amphitryon, general
of the Thebans, during his absence with the army, and by that
means imposing on his wife Alcmena. The play opens while
Jupiter is supposed to be with the object of his passion. Sosia,
the servant of Amphitryon, who had been sent on before by
his master, from the port to announce his victory and approach,
is introduced on the stage, proceeding towards the palace of
Amphitryon. While expressing his astonishment at the length
of the night, he is met, in front of his master’s house, by
Mercury, who had assumed his form, and who, partly by blows
and threats, and partly by leading him to doubt of his own
identity, succeeds in driving him back. This gives Jupiter
time to prosecute his amour, and he departs at dawn. The
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page103">[pg 103]</span><a name="Pg103" id="Pg103" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>improbable story related by Sosia is not believed by his master,
who himself now advances towards his house, from which
Alcmena comes forth, lamenting the departure of her supposed
husband; but seeing Amphitryon, she expresses her surprise
at his speedy return. The jealousy of Amphitryon is thus
excited, and he quits the stage, in order to bring evidence
that he had never till that time quitted his army. Jupiter then
returns, and Amphitryon is afterwards refused access to his
own house by Mercury, who pretends that he does not know
him. At length Jupiter and Amphitryon are confronted. They
are successively questioned as to the events of the late war by
the pilot of the ship in which Amphitryon had returned. As
Jupiter also stands this test of identity, the real Amphitryon
is wrought up to such a pitch of rage and despair, that he
resolves to wreak vengeance on his whole family, and is provoked
even to utter blasphemies, by setting the gods at defiance.
He is supposed immediately after this to have been
struck down by lightning, as, in the next scene, Bromia, the
attendant of Alcmena, rushes out from the house, alarmed at
the tempest, and finds Amphitryon lying prostrate on the
earth. When he has recovered, she announces to him that
during the storm Alcmena had given birth to twins:—
</p>

<div class="tei tei-lg" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em; margin-left: 2.00em; margin-top: 1.00em">

</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Jupiter then, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in propria persona</span></span>, reveals the whole mystery,
and Amphitryon appears to be much flattered by the honour
which had been paid him.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In this play the jealousy and perplexity of Amphitryon are
well portrayed, and the whole character of Alcmena is beautifully
drawn. She is represented as an affectionate wife, full
of innocence and simplicity, and her distress at the suspicions
of the real Amphitryon is highly interesting. The English
translator of Plautus has remarked the great similarity of
manners between her and Desdemona, while placed in similar
circumstances. Both express indignation at being suspected,
but love for their husbands makes them easily reconciled. The
reader, however, feels that Amphitryon and Alcmena remain
in an awkward situation at the conclusion of the piece. It
must also be confessed, that the Roman dramatist has assigned
a strange part to Jupiter Optimus Maximus, at whose
festivals this play is said to have been usually performed; but,
as Voltaire has remarked, <span class="tei tei-q">“Il n’y a que ceux qui ne savent
point combien les hommes agissent peu consequemment, qui
puissent etre surpris, qu’on se moqua publiquement au theatre
des memes dieux qu’on adorait dans les temples.”</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Mistakes are a most fruitful subject of comic incident, and
never could there be such mistakes as those which arise from
two persons being undistinguishable: but then, in order to
give an appearance of verisimilitude on the stage, it was
almost necessary that the play should be represented with
masks, which could alone exhibit the perfect resemblance of
the two Amphitryons and the two Sosias; and even with this
advantage, such errors, in order to possess dramatic plausibility,
must have been founded on some mythological tradition.
The subject, therefore, is but an indifferent one for
the modern stage. Accordingly, Ludovico Dolce, who first
imitated this comedy in his play entitled <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Marito</span></span>, has grossly
erred in transporting the scene from Thebes to Padua, and
assigning the parts of Jupiter and Amphitryon to Messer
Muzio and Fabrizio, two Italian citizens, who were so similar
in appearance, that the wife of one of them, though a sensible
and virtuous woman, is deceived night and day, during her
husband’s absence, by the resemblance, and the deception is
aided by the still more marvellous likeness of their domestics.
In place of Jupiter appearing in the clouds, and justifying
Alcmena, the Italian has introduced a monk, called Fra Girolamo,
who is bribed to persuade the foolish husband that a
spirit (Folletto) had one night transported him to Padua, during
sleep, which satisfactorily accounts to him for the situation in
which he finds his wife on his return home.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These absurdities have been in a great measure avoided in
the imitation by Rotrou, who may be regarded as the father of
the French drama, having first exploded the bad taste which
pervades the pieces of Hardy. His comedy entitled <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Les Deux
Sosies</span></span>, is completely framed on the Amphitryon of Plautus,
only the prologue is spoken by the inveterate Juno, who declaims
against her rivals, and enumerates the labours which
she has in store for the son of Alcmena.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But by far the most celebrated imitation of Plautus is the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Amphitrion</span></span> of Moliere, who has managed with much delicacy
a subject in itself not the most decorous. He has in general
followed the steps of the Roman dramatist, but where he has
departed from them, he has improved on the original. Instead of
the dull and inconsistent prologue delivered by Mercury, which
explains the subject of the piece, he has introduced a scene
between Mercury and Night, (probably suggested by the Dialogues
of Lucian between Mercury and the Sun on the same
occasion,) in which Mercury announces the state of matters
while requesting Night to prolong her stay on earth for the sake
of Jupiter. At the commencement of the piece, Plautus has
made Sosia repeat to himself a very minute, though picturesque
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page105">[pg 105]</span><a name="Pg105" id="Pg105" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>account of the victory of the Thebans, as preparatory to a proper
description of it to Alcmena. This Moliere has formed into
a sort of dialogued soliloquy between Sosia and his Lantern,
which rehearses the answers anticipated from Alcmena, till
the discourse is at length interrupted by the arrival of Mercury,
when the speaker has lost himself among the manœuvres
of the troops. In the Latin <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Amphitryon</span></span>, Mercury threatens
Sosia, and he replies to his rodomontade by puns and quibbles,
which have been omitted by the French poet, who makes
the spectators laugh by the excessive and ridiculous terror of
Sosia, and not by pleasantries inconsistent with his feelings
and situation. Moliere has copied from Plautus the manner
in which Sosia is gradually led to doubt of his own identity:
his consequent confusion of ideas has been closely imitated,
as also the ensuing scenes of the quarrel and reconciliation
between Jupiter and Alcmena. He has added the part of
Cleanthes, the wife of Sosia, suggested to him by a line put
into the mouth of Sosia by Plautus—

</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was certainly ingenious to make the adventures of the slave
a parody on those of his master, and this new character produces
an agreeable scene between her and Mercury, who is
little pleased with the caresses of this antiquated charmer.
On the other hand, the French dramatist has omitted the
examination of the double Amphitryons, and nearly introduces
them in the presence of two Thebans: Amphitryon brings his
friends to avenge him, by assaulting Jupiter, when that god
appears in the clouds and announces the future birth of Hercules.
Through the whole comedy, Moliere has given a different
colour to the behaviour of Jupiter, from that thrown
over it by Plautus. In the Latin play he assumes quite the
character of the husband; but with Moliere he is more of a
lover and gallant, and pays Alcmena so many amorous compliments,
that she exclaims,

The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Amphitrion</span></span> of Moliere was published in 1668, so that
Dryden, in his imitation of Plautus’s <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Amphitryon</span></span>, which first
appeared in 1690, had an opportunity of also availing himself
of the French piece. But, even with this assistance, he has
done Plautus less justice than his predecessor. He has sometimes
borrowed the scenes and incidents of Moliere; but has
too frequently given us ribaldry in the low characters, and
bombast in the higher, instead of the admirable grace and
liveliness of the French dramatist. His comedy commences
earlier than either the French or Latin play. Phœbus makes
his appearance at the opening of the piece. The first
arrival of Jupiter in the shape of Amphitryon is then represented,
apparently in order to introduce Phædra, the attendant
of Alcmena, exacting a promise from her mistress, before she
knew, who had arrived, that they should that night be bed-fellows
as usual since Amphitryon’s absence. To this Phædra,
Dryden has assigned an amour with Mercury, to the great
jealousy of Sosia’s wife, Bromia; and has mixed up the whole
play with pastoral dialogues and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">rondeaus</span></span>, to which, as he<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page107">[pg 107]</span><a name="Pg107" id="Pg107" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
informs us in his dedication, <span class="tei tei-q">“the numerous choir of fair
ladies gave so just an applause.”</span> The scenes of a higher
description are those which have been best managed. The
latest editor, indeed, of the works of Dryden, thinks that
in these parts he has surpassed both the French and Roman
dramatist. <span class="tei tei-q">“The sensation to be expressed,”</span> he remarks, <span class="tei tei-q">“is
not that of sentimental affection, which the good father of
Olympus was not capable of feeling; but love of that grosser
and subordinate kind, which prompted Jupiter in his intrigues,
has been expressed by none of the ancient poets in more
beautiful verse, than that in which Dryden has clothed it, in
the scenes between Jupiter and Alcmena.”</span> Milbourne, who
afterwards so violently attacked the English poet, highly compliments
him on the success of this effort of his dramatic
muse—

The character, however, of Alcmena is, I think, less interesting
in the English than in the Latin play. She is painted by
Plautus as delighted with the glory of her husband. In the
second scene of the second act, after a beautiful complaint
on account of his absence, she consoles herself with the
thoughts of his military renown, and concludes with an eulogy
on valour, which would doubtless be highly popular in a Roman
theatre during the early ages of the Republic—

Lady M. W. Montague gives a curious account, in one of
her letters, of a German play on the subject of Amphitryon,
which she saw acted at Vienna.—<span class="tei tei-q">“As that subject had been
already handled by a Latin, French, and English poet, I was
curious to see what an Austrian author could make of it. I
understand enough of that language to comprehend the greatest
part of it; and, besides, I took with me a lady that had the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page108">[pg 108]</span><a name="Pg108" id="Pg108" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>goodness to explain to me every word. I thought the house
very low and dark; but the comedy admirably recompensed
that defect. I never laughed so much in my life. It began
with Jupiter falling in love out of a peep-hole in the clouds,
and ended with the birth of Hercules. But what was most
pleasant was, the use Jupiter made of his metamorphosis; for
you no sooner saw him under the figure of Amphitryon, but,
instead of flying to Alcmena with the raptures Dryden puts
into his mouth, he sends for Amphitryon’s tailor, and cheats
him of a laced coat, and his banker of a bag of money—a Jew
of a diamond ring, and bespeaks a great supper in his name;
and the greatest part of the comedy turns upon poor Amphitryon’s
being tormented by these people for their debts. Mercury
uses Sosia in the same manner; but I could not easily
pardon the liberty the poet had taken of larding his play with
not only indecent expressions, but such gross words as I do
not think our mob would suffer from a mountebank.”</span>

In nothing can the manners of different ages and countries
be more distinctly traced, than in the way in which the same
subject is treated on the stage. In Plautus, may be remarked
the military enthusiasm and early rudeness of the Romans—in
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Marito</span></span> of L. Dolce, the intrigues of the Italians, and
the constant interposition of priests and confessors in domestic
affairs—in Dryden, the libertinism of the reign of Charles
the Second—and in Moliere, the politeness and refinement of
the court of Louis.

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Asinaria</span></span>, is translated from the Greek of Demophilus, a
writer of the Middle comedy. The subject is the trick put
on an ass-driver by two roguish slaves, in order to get hold
of the money which he brought in payment of some asses he
had purchased from their master, that they might employ it in
supplying the extravagance of their master’s son. The old
man, however, is not the dupe in this play: On the contrary,
he is a confederate in the plot, which was chiefly devised
against his wife, who, having brought her husband a great
portion, imperiously governed his house and family. By this
means the youth is restored to the possession of a mercenary
mistress, from whom he had been excluded by a more wealthy
rival. The father stipulates, as a reward for the part which
he had acted in this stratagem, that he also should have a
share in the favours of his son’s mistress; and the play concludes
with this old wretch being detected by his wife, carousing
at a nocturnal banquet, a wreath of flowers on his
head, with his son and the courtezan. It would appear, from
the concluding address to the spectators, that neither the
moral sense of the author, nor of his audience, was very strong
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page109">[pg 109]</span><a name="Pg109" id="Pg109" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>or correct, as the bystanders on the stage, so far from condemning

more than what was customary:

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Aulularia</span></span>.—It is not known from what Greek author this
play has been taken; but there can be no doubt that it had
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page110">[pg 110]</span><a name="Pg110" id="Pg110" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>its archetype in the Greek drama. The festivals of Ceres
and Bacchus, which in their origin were innocent institutions,
intended to celebrate the blessings of harvest and
vintage, having degenerated by means of priestcraft, became
schools of superstition and debauchery. From the adventures
and intrigues which occurred at the celebration of
religious mysteries, the comic poets of Greece frequently drew
    the incidents of their dramas<a id="noteref_233" name="noteref_233" href="#note_233"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">233</span></span></a>, which often turned on damsels
having been rendered, on such occasions, the mothers of children,
without knowing who were the fathers. In like manner,
the intrigue of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Aulularia</span></span> has its commencement in the
daughter of Euclio being violated during the celebration of
the mysteries of Ceres, without being aware from whom she
had received the injury. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Aulularia</span></span>, however, is principally
occupied with the display of the character of a Miser.
No vice has been so often pelted with the good sentences of
moralists, or so often ridiculed on the stage, as avarice; and
of all the characters that have been there represented, that of
the miser in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Aulularia</span></span> of Plautus, is perhaps the most
entertaining and best supported. Comic dramas have been
divided into those of intrigue and character, and the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Aulularia</span></span> 
is chiefly of the latter description. It is so termed from <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Aula</span></span>, 
or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Olla</span></span>, the diminutive of which is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Aulula</span></span>, signifying the little
earthen pot that contained a treasure which had been concealed
by his grandfather, but had been discovered by Euclio
the miser, who is the principal character of the play. The
prologue is spoken by the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lar Familiaris</span></span> of the house; and
as the play has its origin in the discovery of a treasure deposited
under a hearth, the introduction of this imaginary Being,
if we duly consider the superstitions of the Romans, was
happy and appropriate. The account given by the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lar</span></span> of
the successive generations of misers, is also well imagined, as
it convinces us that Euclio was a genuine miser, and of the
true breed. The household god had disclosed the long-concealed
treasure, as a reward for the piety of Euclio’s daughter,
who presented him with offerings of frankincense and of wine,
which, however, it is not very probable the miser’s daughter
could have procured, especially before the discovery of the
treasure. The story of the precious deposit, of which the
spectators could not possibly have been informed without this
supernatural interposition, being thus related, we are introduced
at once to the knowledge of the principal character,
who, having found the treasure, employs himself in guarding
it, and lives in continual apprehension, lest it should be dis<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page111">[pg 111]</span><a name="Pg111" id="Pg111" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>covered that he possesses it. Accordingly, he is brought on
the stage driving off his servant, that she may not spy him
while visiting this hoard, and afterwards giving directions of
the strictest economy. He then leaves home on an errand
very happily imagined—an attendance at a public distribution
of money to the poor. Megadorus now proposes to marry
his daughter, and Euclio comically enough supposes that he
has discovered something concerning his newly acquired
wealth; but on his offering to take her without a portion, he
is tranquillized, and agrees to the match. Knowing the disposition
of his intended father-in-law, Megadorus sends provisions
to his house, and also cooks, to prepare a marriage-feast,
but the miser turns them out, and keeps what they had brought.
At length his alarm for discovery rises to such a height, that
he hides his treasure in a grove, consecrated to Sylvanus,
which lay beyond the walls of the city. While thus employed,
he is observed by the slave of Lyconides, the young man who
had violated the miser’s daughter. Euclio coming to recreate
himself with the sight of his gold, finds that it is gone. Returning
home in despair, he is met by Lyconides, who, hearing
of the projected nuptials between his uncle and the miser’s
daughter, now apologizes for his conduct; but the miser
applies all that he says concerning his daughter to his lost
treasure. This play is unfortunately mutilated, and ends
with the slave of Lyconides confessing to his master that he
has found the miser’s hoard, and offering to give it up as the
price of his freedom. It may be presumed, however, that, in
the original, Lyconides got possession of the treasure, and by
its restoration to Euclio, so far conciliated his favour, that he
obtained his daughter in marriage. This conclusion, accordingly,
has been adopted by those who have attempted to
finish the comedy in the spirit of the Latin dramatist. It is
completed on this plan by Thornton, the English translator of
Plautus, and by Antonius Codrus Urceus, a professor in the
University of Bologna, who died in the year 1500. Urceus
has also made the miser suddenly change his nature, and
liberally present his new son-in-law with the restored treasure.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The restless inquietude of Euclio, in concealing his gold in
many different places—his terror on seeing the preparations
for the feast, lest the wine brought in was meant to intoxicate
him, that he might be robbed with greater facility—his dilemma
at being obliged to miss the distribution to the poor—are all
admirable traits of extreme and habitual avarice. Even his
recollection of the expense of a rope, when, in despair at the
loss of his treasure, he resolves to hang himself, though a little
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page112">[pg 112]</span><a name="Pg112" id="Pg112" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>overdone, is sufficiently characteristic. But while the part of
a confirmed miser has been comically and strikingly represented
in these touches, it is stretched in others beyond all
bounds of probability. When Euclio entreats his female
servant to spare the cobwebs—when it is said, that he complains
of being pillaged if the smoke issue from his house—and
that he preserves the parings of his nails—we feel this to
be a species of hoarding which no miser could think of or
    enjoy<a id="noteref_234" name="noteref_234" href="#note_234"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">234</span></span></a>.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
One of the earliest imitations of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Aulularia</span></span> was, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">La
Sporta</span></span>, a prose Italian comedy, printed at Florence in 1543,
under the name of Giovam-Battista Gelli, but attributed by
some to Machiavel. It is said, that the great Florentine historian
left this piece, in an imperfect state, in the hands of his
friend Bernardino di Giordano of Florence, in whose house his
comedies were sometimes represented, whence it passed into
the possession of Gelli, a writer of considerable humour, who
prepared it for the press; and, according to a practice not
unfrequent in Italy at different periods, published it as his own
    production<a id="noteref_235" name="noteref_235" href="#note_235"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">235</span></span></a>. The play is called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sporta</span></span>, from the basket in
which the treasure was contained. The plot and incidents in
Plautus have been closely followed, in so far as was consistent
with modern Italian manners; and where they varied, the
circumstances, as well as names, have been adapted by the
author to the customs and ideas of his country. Euclio is
called Ghirorgoro, and Megadorus, Lapo; the former being
set up as a satire on avarice, the latter as a pattern of proper
economy.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The principal plot of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The case is altered</span></span>, a comedy attributed
to Ben Jonson, has been taken, as shall be afterwards shown
from the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Captivi</span></span> of Plautus; but the character of Jaques is
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page113">[pg 113]</span><a name="Pg113" id="Pg113" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>more closely formed on that of Euclio, than any miser on the
modern stage. Jaques having purloined the treasure of a
French Lord Chamont, whose steward he had been, and having
also stolen his infant daughter, fled with them to Italy.
The girl, when she grew up, being very beautiful, had many
suitors; whence her reputed father suspects it is discovered
that he possesses hidden wealth, in the same manner as Euclio
does in the scene with Megadorus. We have a representation
of his excessive anxiety lest he lose this treasure—his concealment
of it—and his examination of Juniper, the cobbler, whom
he suspects to have stolen it; which corresponds to Euclio’s
examination of Strobilus. Most other modern dramatists have
made their miser in love; but in the breast of Jaques all
passions are absorbed in avarice, which is exhibited to us not
so much in ridiculous instances of minute domestic economy,
as in absolute adoration of his gold:

But the most celebrated imitation of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Aulularia</span></span> is Moliere’s
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Avare</span></span>, one of the best and most wonderful imitations
ever produced. Almost nothing is of the French dramatist’s
own invention. Scenes have been selected by him from a
number of different plays, in various languages, which have no
relation to each other; but every thing is so well connected,
that the whole appears to have been invented for this single
comedy. Though chiefly indebted to Plautus, he has not so
closely followed his original as in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Amphitryon</span></span>. One
difference, which materially affects the plots of the two plays
and characters of the misers, is, that Euclio was poor till he
unexpectedly found the treasure. He was not known to be
rich, and lived in constant dread of his wealth being discovered.
When any thing was said about riches, he applied it to himself;
and when well received or caressed by any one, he supposed
that he was ensnared. Harpagon, on the other hand, had
amassed a fortune, and was generally known to possess it,
which gives an additional zest to the humour, as we thus enter
into the merriment of his family and neighbours; whereas the
penury of Euclio could scarcely have appeared unreasonable
to the bystanders, who were not in the secret of the acquired
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page114">[pg 114]</span><a name="Pg114" id="Pg114" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>treasure. Moliere has also made his miser in love, or at least
resolved to marry, and amuses us with his anxiety, in believing
himself under the necessity of giving a feast to his intended
bride; which is still better than Euclio’s consternation at the
supper projected by his intended son-in-law. Euclio is constantly
changing the place where he conceals his casket;
Harpagon allows it to remain, but is chiefly occupied with its
security. The idea, however, of so much incident turning on
a casket, is not so happily imagined in the French as in the
Latin comedy; since, in the latter, it was the whole treasure
of which the miser was possessed, and there was at that time
no mode of lending it out safely and to advantage. Harpagon
gives a collation, but orders the fragments to be sent back to
those who had provided it; Euclio retains the provisions,
which had been procured at another’s expense. From the
restraint imposed by modern manners, and the circumstance
of Harpagon being known to be rich, Moliere has been forced
to omit the amusing dilemmas in which Euclio is placed with
regard to his attendance on the distributions to the poor. In
recompense, he has wonderfully improved the scene about the
dowry, as also that in which the miser applies what is said
concerning his daughter to his lost treasure; and, on the whole,
he has displayed the passion of avarice in more of the incidents
and relations of domestic life than the Latin poet. Plautus
had remained satisfied with exhibiting a miser, who deprived
himself of all the comforts of life, to watch night and day over
an unproductive treasure; but Moliere went deeper into the
mind. He knew that avarice is accompanied with selfishness,
and hardness of heart, and falsehood, and mistrust, and usury;
and accordingly, all these vices and evil passions are amalgamated
with the character of the French miser.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Aulularia</span></span> being a play of character, I have been led
to compare the most celebrated imitations of it rather in the
exhibition of the miserly character than in the incidents of
the piece. Many of the latter which occur in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Avare</span></span>, have
not been borrowed from Plautus, yet are not of Moliere’s invention.
Thus he has added from the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pedant Joué</span></span> of Cyrano
Bergerac that part of the plot which consists in the love of
the miser and his son for the same woman, as also that which
relates to Valere, a young gentleman in love with the miser’s
daughter, who had got into his service in disguise, and who,
when the miser lost his money, which his son’s servant had
stolen, was accused by another servant of having purloined it.
Moliere’s notion of the miser’s prodigal son borrowing money
from a usurer, and the usurer afterwards proving to be his father,
is from <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">La Belle Plaideuse</span></span>, a comedy of Bois-Robert. In an
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page115">[pg 115]</span><a name="Pg115" id="Pg115" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Italian piece, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Le Case Svaligiate</span></span>, prior to the time of Moliere,
and in the harlequin taste, Scapin persuades Pantaloon that
the young beauty with whom he is captivated returns his love,
that she sets a particular value on old age, and dislikes youthful
admirers, whence Pantaloon is induced to give his purse to
the flatterer. Frosine attacks the vanity of Harpagon in the
same manner, but he, though not unmoved by the flattery,
retains his money. Moliere has availed himself of a number
of other Italian dramas of the same description for scattered
remarks and situations. The name of Harpagon has been
suggested to him by the continuation of Codrus Urceus, where
Strobilus says that the masters of the present day are so avaricious,
that they may be called Harpies or Harpagons:

</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I do not know where Moliere received the hint of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">denouement</span></span>
of his piece. The conclusion of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Aulularia</span></span>, as
already mentioned, is not extant, but it could not have been
so improbable and inartificial as the discovery of Valere and
Marianne for the children of Thomas D’Alburci, who, under
the name of Anselme, had courted the miser’s daughter.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Shadwell, Fielding, and Goldoni, enjoyed the advantage of
studying Moliere’s Harpagon for their delineations of Goldingham,
Lovegold, and Ottavio. In the miser of Shadwell there
is much indecency indeed of his own invention, and some disgusting
representations of city vulgarity and vice; but still he
is hardly entitled to the praise of so much originality as he
claims in his impudent preface.—<span class="tei tei-q">“The foundation of this
play,”</span> says he, <span class="tei tei-q">“I took from one of Moliere’s, called L’Avare,
but that having too few persons, and too little action for an
English theatre, I added to both so much, that I may call
more than half of this play my own; and I think I may say,
without vanity, that Moliere’s part of it has not suffered in my
hands. Nor did I ever know a French comedy made use of
by the worst of our poets that was not bettered by them. It
is not barrenness of art or invention makes us borrow from the
French, but laziness; and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">this</span></span> was the occasion of my making
use of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">L’Avare</span></span>.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Fielding’s <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Miser</span></span>, the only one of his comedies which does
him credit, is a much more agreeable play than Shadwell’s.
The earlier scenes are a close imitation of Moliere, but the
concluding ones are somewhat different, and the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">denouement</span></span>
is perhaps improved. Mariana is in a great measure a new
character, and those of the servants are rendered more prominent
and important than in the French original.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The miser Ottavio, in Goldoni’s <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vero Amico</span></span>, is entirely
copied from Plautus and Moliere. In the Italian play, however,
the character is in a great measure episodical, and the
principal plot, which gives its title to the piece, and corresponds
with that of Diderot’s <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Fils Naturel</span></span>, has been invented
by the Italian dramatist.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On the whole, Moliere has succeeded best in rendering the
passion of avarice hateful: Plautus and Goldoni have only
made it ridiculous. The profound and poetical avarice of
Jaques possesses something plaintive in its tone, which almost
excites our sympathy, and never our laughter; he is represented
as a worshipper of gold, somewhat as an old Persian
might be of the sun, and he does not raise our contempt by
the absurdities of domestic economy. But Harpagon is
thoroughly detestable, and is in fact detested by his neighbours,
domestics, and children. All these dramatists are
accused of having exhibited rather an allegorical representation
of avarice, than the living likeness of a human Being
influenced by that odious propensity. <span class="tei tei-q">“Plautus,”</span> says Hurd,
<span class="tei tei-q">“and also Moliere, offended in this, that for the picture of
the avaricious man they presented us with a fantastic unpleasing
draught of the passion of avarice—I call it a fantastic
draught, because it hath no archetype in nature, and it is
farther an unpleasing one; from being the delineation of a
simple passion, unmixed, it wants</span>

</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This may in general be true, as there are certainly few unmingled
passions; but I suspect that avarice so completely
engrosses the soul, that a simple and unmixed delineation of
it is not remote from nature. <span class="tei tei-q">“The Euclio of Plautus,”</span> says
King, in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Anecdotes</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">“the Avare of Moliere, and Miser of

This information, however, cannot be implicitly relied on, as
the prologue was not written in the time of Plautus, and is
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page117">[pg 117]</span><a name="Pg117" id="Pg117" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>evidently an addition of a comparatively recent date. Some
indeed have supposed that it was prefixed by Petrarch; but
at all events the following lines could not have been anterior

The leading incident in this play—a master’s folly and inadvertence
counteracting the deep-laid scheme of a slave to
forward his interest, has been employed by many modern
dramatists for the groundwork of their plots; as we find from
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Inavertito</span></span> of Nicolo Barbieri, sirnamed Beltramo, the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Amant Indiscret</span></span> of Quinault, Moliere’s <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Etourdi</span></span>, and Dryden’s

The third scene of the third act of this comedy, where the
father of Pistoclerus speaks with so much indulgence of the
follies of youth, has been imitated in Moliere’s <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Fourberies de

Though no females are introduced in it, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Captivi</span></span> is the
most tender and amiable of Plautus’ plays, and may be regarded
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page118">[pg 118]</span><a name="Pg118" id="Pg118" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>as of a higher description than his other comedies, since it
hinges on paternal affection and the fidelity of friendship.
Many of the situations are highly touching, and exhibit actions
of generous magnanimity, free from any mixture of burlesque.
It has indeed been considered by some critics as the origin of
that class of dramas, which, under the title of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Comedies Larmoyantes</span></span>,
was at one time so much admired and so fashionable

Hegio, an Ætolian gentleman, had two sons, one of whom,
when only four years old, was carried off by a slave, and sold
by him in Elis. A war having subsequently broken out between
the Elians and Ætolians, Hegio’s other son was taken captive
by the Elians. The father, with a view of afterwards ransoming
his son, by an exchange, purchased an Elian prisoner,
called Philocrates, along with his servant Tyndarus; and the
play opens with the master, Philocrates, personating his slave,
while the slave, Tyndarus, assumes the character of his master.
By this means Tyndarus remains a prisoner under his master’s
name, while Hegio is persuaded to send the true Philocrates,
under the name of Tyndarus, to Elis, in order to effect the
exchange of his son. The deception, however, is discovered
by Hegio before the return of Philocrates; and the father,
fearing that he had thus lost all hope of ransoming his child,
condemns Tyndarus to labour in the mines. In these circumstances,
Philocrates returns from Elis with Hegio’s son, and
also brings along with him the fugitive slave, who had stolen
his other son in infancy. It is then discovered that Tyndarus
is this child, who, having been sold to the father of Philocrates,
was appointed by him to wait on his son, and had been
gradually admitted to his young master’s confidence and
friendship.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There has been a great dispute among critics and commentators,
whether the dramatic unities have been strictly observed
in this comedy. M. De Coste, in the preface to his French
translation of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Captivi</span></span>, maintains, that the unities of place,
and time, and action, have been closely attended to. Lessing,
who translated the play into German, adopted the opinion of
De Coste with regard to the observance of the unities, and he
has farther pronounced it the most perfect comedy that, in his
    time, had yet been represented on the stage<a id="noteref_239" name="noteref_239" href="#note_239"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">239</span></span></a>. A German
critic, whose letter addressed to Lessing is published in that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page119">[pg 119]</span><a name="Pg119" id="Pg119" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>author’s works<a id="noteref_240" name="noteref_240" href="#note_240"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">240</span></span></a>, has keenly opposed these opinions, discussing
at considerable length the question of the unities of action,
time, and place, as also pointing out many supposed inconsistencies
and improbabilities in the conduct of the drama. He
objects, in point of verisimilitude, to the long and numerous
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">aparts</span></span>—the soliloquies of the parasite, which begin the first
three acts,—the frequent mention of the market-places and
streets of Rome, while the scene is laid in a town of Greece,—and
the sudden as well as unaccountable appearance of
Stalagmus, the fugitive slave, at the end of the drama. The
most serious objection, however, is that which relates to the
violation of the dramatic unity of time. The scene is laid in
Calydon, the capital of Ætolia; and, at the end of the second
act, Philocrates proceeds from that city to Elis, transacts there
a variety of affairs, and returns before the play is concluded.
Between these two places the distance is fifty miles; and in
going from one to the other it was necessary to cross the bay
of Corinth. It is therefore impossible (contends this critic,)
that De Coste can be accurate in maintaining that the duration 
of the drama is only seven or eight hours. Allowing the
poet, however, the greatest poetical license, and giving for
his play the extended period of twenty-four hours, it is scarcely
possible that the previous parts of the drama could have been
gone through, and the long voyage accomplished, in this space
of time. But it farther appears, that Plautus himself did not
wish to claim this indulgence, and intended to crowd the
journey and all the preceding dramatic incidents into twelve
hours at most. He evidently means that the action should be
understood as commencing with the morning: Hegio says, in
the second scene of the first act,
</p>

<div class="tei tei-lg" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em; margin-left: 2.00em; margin-top: 1.00em">

</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
and it is evident that the action terminates with the evening
meal, the preparations for which conclude the fourth act. To
all this Lessing replied, that there was no reason to suppose
that the scene was laid in Calydon, or that the journey was
made to the town of Elis, and that it might easily have been
accomplished within the time prescribed by the dramatic rule
of unities, if nearer points of the Ætolian and Elian territories
be taken than their capitals.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Some of the characters in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Captivi</span></span> are very beautifully
drawn. Hegio is an excellent representation of a respectable
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page120">[pg 120]</span><a name="Pg120" id="Pg120" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>rich old citizen: He is naturally a humane good-humoured
man, but his disposition is warped by excess of paternal tenderness.
There is not in any of the comedies of Plautus, a
more agreeable and interesting character than Tyndarus: and
no delineation can be more pleasing than that of his faithful
attachment to Philocrates, by whom he was in return implicitly
trusted, and considered rather in the light of a friend than a
slave. In this play, as in most others of Plautus, the parasite
is a character somewhat of an episodical description: He goes
about prowling for a supper, and is associated to the main
subject of the piece only by the delight which he feels at the
prospect of a feast, to honour the return of Hegio’s son. The
parasites of Plautus are almost as deserving a dissertation as
Shakspeare’s clowns. Parasite, as is well known, was a name
originally applied in Greece to persons devoted to the service
of the gods, and who were appointed for the purpose of keeping
the consecrated provisions of the temples. Diodorus of
    Sinope, as quoted by Athenæus<a id="noteref_241" name="noteref_241" href="#note_241"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">241</span></span></a>, after speaking of the dignity
of the sacred parasites of Hercules, (who was himself a noted
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">gourmand</span></span>,) mentions that the rich, in emulation of this demi-god,
chose as followers persons called parasites, who were
not selected for their virtues or talents, but were remarkable
for extravagant flattery to their superiors, and insolence to
those inferiors who approached the persons of their patrons.
This was the character which came to be represented on the
    stage. We learn from Athenæus<a id="noteref_242" name="noteref_242" href="#note_242"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">242</span></span></a>, that a parasite was introduced
in one of his plays by Epicharmus, the founder of the
Greek comedy. The parasite of this ancient dramatist lay at
the feet of the rich, eat the offals from their tables, and drank
the dregs of their cups. He speaks of himself as of a person
ever ready to dine abroad when invited, and when any one is
to be married, to go to his house without an invitation—to
pay for his good cheer by exciting the merriment of the company,
and to retire as soon as he had eat and drunk sufficiently,
without caring whether or not he was lighted out by the
    slaves<a id="noteref_243" name="noteref_243" href="#note_243"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">243</span></span></a>. In the most ancient comedies, however, this character
was not denominated parasite, and was first so called in
the plays of Araros, the son of Aristophanes, and one of the
earliest authors of the middle comedy. Antiphanes, a dramatist
of the same class, has given a very full description of the
vocation of a parasite. The part, however, did not become
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page121">[pg 121]</span><a name="Pg121" id="Pg121" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>extremely common till the introduction of the new comedy,
when Diphilus, whose works were frequently imitated on the
Roman stage, particularly distinguished himself by his delineation

part was usually represented by young men, dressed in a black
or brown garb, and wearing masks expressive of malignant
gaiety. They carried a goblet suspended round their waists,
probably lest the slaves of their patrons should fill to them in
too small cups; and also a vial of oil to be used at the bath,
which was a necessary preparation before sitting down to
table, for which the parasite required to be always ready at a
    moment’s warning<a id="noteref_245" name="noteref_245" href="#note_245"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">245</span></span></a>.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was thus, too, that the character was represented on the
Roman stage; and it would farther appear, that the parasites,
in the days of Plautus, carried with them a sort of Joe Miller,
as a manual of wit, with which they occasionally refreshed
their vivacity. Thus the parasite, in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Stichus</span></span>, says,

The parasite naturally became a leading character of the
Roman stage. In spite of the pride and boasted national independence
of its citizens, the whole system of manners at
Rome was parasitical. The connection between patron and
client, which was originally the cordial intercourse of reciprocal
services, soon became that of haughty superiority on
the one side, and sordid adulation on the other. Every client
was in fact the parasite of some patrician, whose litter he
often followed like a slave, conforming to all his caprices, and
submitting to all his insults, for the privilege of being placed
at the lowest seat of the patron’s table, and there repaying
this indelicate hospitality by the most servile flattery. On the
stage, the principal use of the parasite was to bring out the
other characters from the canvass. Without Gnatho, the
Thraso of Terence would have possessed less confidence; and
without his flatterer, Pyrgopolinices would never have recollected
breaking an elephant’s thigh by a blow of his fist.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The parasite, in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Captivi</span></span>, may be considered as a fair
enough representative of his brethren in the other plays of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page122">[pg 122]</span><a name="Pg122" id="Pg122" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Plautus. He submits patiently to all manner of ignominious
    treatment<a id="noteref_246" name="noteref_246" href="#note_246"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">246</span></span></a>—his spirits rise and sink according as his prospects
of a feast become bright or clouded—he speaks a great deal in
soliloquies, in which he talks much of the jests by which he
attempted to recommend himself as a guest at the feasts of the
Great, but we are not favoured with any of these jests. In
such soliloquies, too, he rather expresses what would justly be
thought of him by others, than what even a parasite was likely
to say of himself.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The parasite is not a character which has been very frequently
represented on the modern stage. It is not one into which an
Italian audience, who are indifferent to good cheer, would
heartily enter. Accordingly, the parasite is not a common
character in the native drama of Italy, and is chiefly exhibited
in the old comedies of Ariosto and Aretine, which are directly
imitated from the plays of Plautus or Terence; but even in
them this character does not precisely coincide with the older
and more genuine school of parasites. Ligurio, who is called
the parasite in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Mandragora</span></span> of Machiavel, rather corresponds
to the intriguing slave than to the parasite of the Roman
drama; or at least he resembles the more modern parasites,
who, like the Phormio of Terence, ingratiated themselves with
their patrons by serviceable roguery, rather than by flattery.
Ipocrito, who, in Aretine’s comedy of that name, is also styled
the parasite, is a sort of Tartuffe, with charitable and religious
maxims constantly in his mouth. He does not insinuate
himself into the confidence of his patrons by a gaping admiration
of their foolish sayings, but by extolling their virtues,
and smoothing over their vices; and so far from being treated
with any sort of contumely, he is held in high consideration,
and interposes in all domestic arrangements.

It is still more difficult to find a true parasite on the English
stage. Sir John Falstaff, though something of a parasite, is as
original as he is inimitable. Lazarillo, the hungry courtier in
Beaumont and Fletcher’s <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Woman Hater</span></span>, and Justice Greedy,
in Massinger’s <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">New Way to Pay Old Debts</span></span>, to whom Sir
Giles Overreach gives the command of the kitchen, and absolute
authority there, in respect of the entertainment, are
rather epicures in constant quest of delicacies, than hungry
parasites, who submit to any indignity for the sake of a meal.
Lazarillo’s whole intrigue consists of schemes for being invited
to dine where there was an umbrana’s head, and we are told
that

pheasant, or a red deer baked in puff paste. Mosca, in Ben
Jonson’s <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Volpone</span></span>, who grasps at presents made to him by the
legacy-hunters of his patron, and who at length attempts to
defraud the patron himself, is a parasite of infinitely greater
artifice and villainy than any of those in Plautus; and in the
opinion of the late editor of Jonson, outweighs the aggregate
merit of all Plautus’s parasites. Colax, who, in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Muses’
Looking-Glass</span></span> of Randolph, chimes in with the sentiments of
each character, approving, by an immense variety of subtle
arguments, every extreme of vice and folly, appears to flatter
all those allegorical representations of the passions exhibited
in this drama, rather from courtesy than want. He tells us,
indeed, that

but this part of his character is not brought prominently forward,
nor is he represented as a glutton or epicure. Perhaps
the character which comes nearest to the parasite of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Captivi</span></span>
is in a play not very generally known, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Canterbury

But although it might be difficult to find a precise copy in
modern times of the parasite of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Captivi</span></span>, its principal plot
has been repeatedly imitated, particularly in an old English
drama, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Case is altered</span></span>, supposed to have been written by
Ben Jonson, and published in some editions of his works.
Count Ferneze, a nobleman of Vicenza, and who corresponds
to Hegio, lost a son called Camillo, when Vicenza was taken
by the French. His other son, Paulo, is afterwards made
prisoner by the same enemies. Chamont, the French general,
and Camillo Ferneze, who, under the name of Gaspar, had
entered into the French service, are taken prisoners by the
Italians; and while in captivity they agree to change names, and
apparent situations. Camillo, who passes for Chamont, is
carefully retained in confinement at Vicenza, while that general
is despatched by the Count Ferneze to procure the ransom of
his son Paulo. The Count having subsequently detected the
imposture, Camillo is put in fetters and ordered for execution.
Chamont, however, returns with Paulo, whom he had now
redeemed, and the Count afterwards discovers, by means of a
tablet hanging round his neck, that the youth Camillo, whom
he was treating with such severity, was the son whom he had
lost during the sack of Vicenza.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Captivi</span></span> is also the foundation of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Les Captifs</span></span>, a comedy
of Rotrou, where a father, afflicted by the captivity of a son,
purchases all the slaves exposed to sale in Ætolia, in the
hope of recovering his child. The interest and vivacity of
the play, which is one of the best of its author, are supported
by the pleasantries of a parasite, and a variety of ingenious
incidents. Ginguené has mentioned, in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Histoire Litteraire
d’Italie</span></span>, that the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Captivi</span></span> must also have suggested the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Suppositi</span></span>, a comedy by the author of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Orlando Furioso</span></span>.
Ariosto, however, has made the incidents of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Captivi</span></span> subservient
to a love intrigue, and not to the deliverance of a
prisoner. Whilst Erostrato, a young gentleman, acts the part
of a domestic in the house of his mistress’s father, his servant,
Dulippo, personates his master, and studies in his place at the
university of Ferrara. At the conclusion of the piece, Dulippo
is discovered to be the son of an old and rich doctor of laws,
who was the rival in love of Erostrato. There is a parasite in
this play as in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Captivi</span></span>, but the character of the doctor is
new, and the scenes chiefly consist of the schemes which are
laid by the master and servant to disappoint his views as to
the lady of whom Erostrato is enamoured.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Casina</span></span>. This play is so called from the name of a female
slave, on whom, though she does not once appear on the
stage, the whole plot of the drama hinges. It is said in the
prologue to have been translated from Diphilus, a Greek
writer of the new comedy, by whom it was called <span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-family: Gentium, 'New Athena Unicode', 'DejaVu Serif', 'Lucida Grande', 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Palatino Linotype', serif">Κληρουμενοι</span></span>,
the Lot Drawers. Diphilus was a contemporary of Menander;
he was distinguished by his comic wit and humour and occasionally
by the moral sententious character of his dramas, of
which he is said to have written a hundred, and from which
larger fragments have been preserved than from any Greek
plays belonging to the new comedy. Notwithstanding what
is said in the Delphine Plautus, it is evident from its terms,
that the prologue could not have been prefixed by the dramatist
himself, but must have been written a good many years
after his death, on occasion of a revival of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Casina</span></span>. It
would appear from it that the plays of Plautus had rather gone
out of fashion immediately after his death; but the public at
length, tired with the new comedies, began to call for the
reproduction of those of Plautus—

It cannot, indeed, be denied, that, in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Casina</span></span>, the unities
of time and place are rigidly observed, and, in point of
humour, it is generally accounted inferior to none of Plautus’s
dramas. The nature, however, of the subject, will
admit only of a very slight sketch. The female slave, who
gives name to the comedy, is beloved by her master, Stalino,
and by his son, Euthynicus,—the former of whom employs
Olympio, his bailiff in the country, and the latter his armour-bearer,
Chalinus, to marry Casina, each being in hopes, by
this contrivance, to obtain possession of the object of his
affections. Cleostrata, Stalino’s wife, suspecting her husband’s
designs, supports the interests of her son, and, after
much dispute, it is settled, that the claims of the bailiff and
armour-bearer should be decided by lot. Fortune having
declared in favour of the former, Stalino obtains the loan of
a neighbour’s house for the occasion, and it is arranged, that
its mistress should be invited for one evening by Cleostrata;
but the jealous lady counteracts this plan by declining the
honour of the visit. At length all concur in making a dupe
of the old man. Chalinus is dressed up in wedding garments
to personate Casina, and the play concludes with the mortification
of Stalino, at finding he had been imposed on by a
counterfeit bride.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The plan here adopted by Stalino for securing possession
of Casina, is nearly the same with that pursued by the Count
Almaviva, in Beaumarchais’ prose comedy, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Le Marriage de
Figaro</span></span>; where the Count, with similar intentions, plans a
marriage between Suzanne and his valet-de-chambre, Figaro,
but has his best-laid schemes invariably frustrated. The concluding
part of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Casina</span></span> has probably, also, suggested the
whole of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Marescalco</span></span>, a comedy of the celebrated Aretine,
which turns on the projected nuptials of the character who
gives name to the piece, and whose supposed bride is discovered,
during the performance of the marriage ceremony, to
be a page of the Duke of Mantua, dressed up in wedding garments,
in a frolic of the Duke’s courtiers, in order to impose
on the Marescalco. Those scenes in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ragazzo</span></span> of Lodovico
Dolce, where a similar deception is practised and where
Giacchetto, the disguised youth, minutely details the event
of the trick of which he was made the chief instrument,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page126">[pg 126]</span><a name="Pg126" id="Pg126" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>have also been evidently drawn from the same productive
    origin.<a id="noteref_247" name="noteref_247" href="#note_247"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">247</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The closest imitation, however, of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Casina</span></span>, is Machiavel’s
comedy <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Clitia</span></span>. Many of its scenes, indeed, have been
literally translated from the Latin, and the incidents are
altered in very few particulars. The Stalino of Plautus is
called Nicomaco, and his wife Sofronia: their son is named
Cleandro, and the dependents employed to court Clitia for
behoof of their masters, Eustachio and Pirro. The chief
difference is, that the young lover, who is supposed to be
absent in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Casina</span></span>, is introduced on the stage by the Italian
author, and the object of his affections is a young lady,
brought up and educated by his parents, and originally
intrusted to their care by one of their friends, which makes
the proposal of her marrying either of the servants offered to
her choice more absurd than in the Latin original. The
bridal garments, too, are not assumed by one of the rival
servants, but by a third character, introduced and employed
for the purpose. This comedy of Machiavel, his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Mandragola</span></span>, 
and the renowned tale of Belfegor, were the productions
with which that profound politician and historian, who established
a school of political philosophy in the Italian seat of
the Muses—who applied a fine analysis to the Roman history,
and a subtler than Aristotle to the theory of government—attempted,
as he himself has so beautifully expressed it,

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cistellaria</span></span>, (the Casket.)—The prologue to this play is
spoken by the god <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Auxilium</span></span>, at the end of the first act. It
explains the subject of the piece—compliments the Romans
on their power and military glory—and concludes with exhorting
them to overcome the Carthaginians, and punish them as
they deserve. Hence it is probable, that this play was
written during the second Punic war, which terminated in the
year 552; and as Plautus was born in the year 525, it may be
plausibly conjectured, that the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cistellaria</span></span> was one of his
earliest productions. This also appears from its greater rudeness
when compared with his other plays, and from the shortness
and simplicity of the plot. But though the argument is
trite and sterile, it is enlivened by a good deal of comic
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page127">[pg 127]</span><a name="Pg127" id="Pg127" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
humour, particularly in the delineation of some of the subordinate
characters. Like many others of Plautus’s plays, it
turns on the accidental recognition of a lost child by her
parents, in consequence of the discovery of a casket, containing
some toys, which had been left with her when exposed,
and by means of which she is identified and acknowledged.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In ancient times these recognitions, so frequently exhibited
on the stage, were not improbable. The customs of exposing
children, and of reducing prisoners of war to slavery—the
little connection or intercourse between different countries,
from the want of inns or roads—and the consequent difficulty
of tracing a lost individual—rendered such incidents, to us
apparently so marvellous, of not unusual occurrence in real
life. In Greece, particularly, divided as it was into a number
of small states, and surrounded by a sea infested with pirates,
who carried on a commerce in slaves, free-born children were
frequently carried off, and sold in distant countries. By the
laws of Athens, marriage with a foreigner was null; or, at
least, the progeny of such nuptials were considered as illegitimate,
and not entitled to the privileges of Athenian citizens.
Hence, the recognition of the supposed stranger was
of the utmost importance to herself and lover. In real life,
this recognition may have been sometimes actually aided by
ornaments and trinkets. Parents frequently tied jewels and
rings to the children whom they exposed, in order that such
as found them might be encouraged to nourish and educate
them, and that they themselves might afterwards be enabled
    to discover them, if Providence took care for their safety<a id="noteref_248" name="noteref_248" href="#note_248"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">248</span></span></a>.
Plots, accordingly, which hinged on such circumstances, were
invented even by the writers of the old Greek comedy. One
of the later pieces of Aristophanes, now lost, entitled <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cocalus</span></span>, 
is said to have presented a recognition; and nearly the same
sort of intrigue was afterwards employed by Menander, and,
from his example, by Plautus and Terence. From imitation
of the Greek and Latin comedies, similar incidents became
common both in dramatic and romantic fiction. The pastoral
romance of Longus hinges on a recognition of this species;
and those elegant productions, in which the Italians have
introduced the characters and occupations of rural life into
the drama, are frequently founded on the exposure of children,
who, after being brought up as shepherds by reputed fathers,
are recognised by their real parents, from ornaments or tokens
fastened to their persons when abandoned in infancy or childhood.

The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cistellaria</span></span> has been more directly imitated in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Gli

of the sixteenth century. That part, however, of the plot
which gives name to the piece, has been invented by the
Italian author himself.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Curculio</span></span>.—The subject of this play, turns on a recognition
similar to that which occurs in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cistellaria</span></span>. It derives its
title from the name of a parasite, who performs the part
usually assigned by Plautus to an intriguing slave; and he is
called Curculio, from a species of worm which eats through
corn.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is worthy of observation, that in the fourth act of this
play, the Choragus, who was master of the Chorus, and stage-manager,
or leader of the band, is introduced, expressing his
fear lest he should be deprived of the clothes he had lent to
Curculio, and addressing to the spectators a number of satirical
remarks on Roman manners.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Vossius has noticed the inadvertency or ignorance of Plautus
in this drama, where, though the scene is laid in Epidaurus,
he sends the parasite to Caria, and brings him back in four
days. This part of the comedy he therefore thinks has been
invented by Plautus himself, since a Greek poet, to whom the
geography of these districts must have been better known,
would not have carried the parasite to so great a distance in
so short a period.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Epidicus</span></span>.—This play is so called from the name of a slave
who sustains a principal character in the comedy, and on
whose rogueries most of the incidents depend. Its most
serious part consists in the discovery of a damsel, who proves
to be sister to a young man by whom she has been purchased
as a slave. The play has no prologue; but, at the beginning,
a character is introduced, which the ancients called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">persona
protatica</span></span>,—that is, a person who enters only once, and at the
commencement of the piece, for the sake of unfolding the
argument, and does not appear again in any part of the drama.
Such are Sosia, in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Andria</span></span> of Terence, and Davus, in his

informing the audience of the circumstances previous to the

narrative is made merely for the sake of the spectators; as
there seldom appears a sufficient reason for one of the parties
being so communicative to the other. Such explanations

But, though popular in the ancient theatre, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Epidicus</span></span> does
not appear to be one of the plays of Plautus which has been
most frequently imitated on the modern stage. There was,
however, a very early Italian imitation of it in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Emilia</span></span>, a
comedy of Luigi da Groto, better known by the appellation of
Cieco D’Adria, one of the earliest romantic poets of his country.
The trick, too, of Epidicus, in persuading his master to buy a
slave with whom his son was in love, has suggested the first
device fallen on by Mascarelle, the valet in Moliere’s <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Etourdi</span></span>,
in order to place the female slave Celie at the disposal of her
lover, by inducing his master to purchase her.

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Menæchmi</span></span>—hinges on something of the same species of
humour as the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Amphitryon</span></span>—a doubt and confusion with regard
to the identity of individuals. According to the Delphin
Plautus, it was taken from a lost play of Menander, entitled
<span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-family: Gentium, 'New Athena Unicode', 'DejaVu Serif', 'Lucida Grande', 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Palatino Linotype', serif">Διδυμοι</span></span>; but other commentators have thought, that it was
more probably derived from Epicharmus, or some other Sicilian
dramatist.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In this play, a merchant of Syracuse had two sons, possessing
so strong a personal resemblance to each other, that they
could not be distinguished even by their parents. One of
these children, called Menæchmus, was lost by his father in a
crowd on the streets of Syracuse, and, being found by a Greek
merchant, was carried by him to Epidamnum, (Dyracchium,)
and adopted as his son. Meanwhile the brother, (whose name,
in consequence of this loss, had been changed to Menæchmus,)
having grown up, had set out from Syracuse in quest of his
relative. After a long search he arrived at Epidamnum, where
his brother had by this time married, and had also succeeded
to the merchant’s fortune. The amusement of the piece hinges
on the citizens of Epidamnum mistaking the Syracusan stranger
for his brother, and the family of the Epidamnian brother
falling into a corresponding error. In this comedy we have
also the everlasting parasite; and the first act opens with a
preparation for an entertainment, which Menæchmus of Epidamnum
had ordered for his mistress Erotium, and to which
the parasite was invited. The Syracusan happening to pass,
is asked to come in by his brother’s mistress, and partakes
with her of the feast. He also receives from her, in order to
bear it to the embroiderer’s, a robe which his brother had
carried off from his wife, with the view of presenting it to this
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page130">[pg 130]</span><a name="Pg130" id="Pg130" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>mistress. Afterwards he is attacked by his brother’s jealous
wife, and her father; and, as his answers to their reproaches
convince them that he is deranged, they send straightway for
a physician. The Syracusan escapes; but they soon afterwards
lay hold of the Epidamnian, in order to carry him to
the physician’s house, when the servant of the Syracusan, who
mistakes him for his master, rescues him from their hands.
The Epidamnian then goes to his mistress with the view of
persuading her to return the robe to his wife. At length the
whole is unravelled by the two Menæchmi meeting; when the
servant of the Syracusan, surprised at their resemblance, discovers,
after a few questions to each, that Menæchmus of
Epidamnum is the twin-brother of whom his master had been
so long in search, and who now agrees to return with them to
Syracuse.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The great number of those Latin plays, where the merriment
consists in mistakes arising from personal resemblances, must
be attributed to the use of masks, which gave probability to
such dramas; and yet, if the resemblance was too perfect, the
humour, I think, must have lost its effect, as the spectators
would not readily perceive the error that was committed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
No play has been so repeatedly imitated as the Menæchmi on
the modern stage, particularly the Italian, where masks were
also frequently employed. The most celebrated Italian imitation
of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Menæchmi</span></span> is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lo Ipocrito</span></span> of Aretine, where the
twin-brothers, Liseo and Brizio, had the same singular degree
of resemblance as the Menæchmi. Brizio had been carried
off a prisoner in early youth during the sack of Milan, and returns
to that city, after a long absence, in the first act of the
play, in quest of his relations. Liseo’s servants, and his parasite,
Lo Ipocrito, all mistake Brizio for their patron, and his
wife takes him to share an entertainment prepared at her husband’s
house, and also intrusts him with the charge of some
ornaments belonging to her daughter; while, on the other
hand, Brizio’s servant mistakes Liseo for his master. The
interest of the play arises from the same sort of confusion as
that which occurs in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Menæchmi</span></span>; and from the continual
astonishment of those who are deceived by the resemblance,
at finding an individual deny a conversation which they were
persuaded he had held a few minutes before. The play is
otherwise excessively involved, in consequence of the introduction
of the amours and nuptials of the five daughters of
Liseo. The plot of the Latin comedy has also been followed
in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Le Moglie</span></span> of Cecchi, and in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lucidi</span></span> of Agnuolo Firenzuola;
but the incidents have been, in a great measure, adapted
by these dramatists to the manners of their native country.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page131">[pg 131]</span><a name="Pg131" id="Pg131" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Trissino, in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Simillimi</span></span>, has made little change on his original,
except adding a chorus of sailors; as, indeed, he has
himself acknowledged, in his dedication to the cardinal, Alessandro
Farnese. In <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Gli due Gemelli</span></span>, which was long a
favourite piece on the Italian stage, Carlini acted both brothers;
the scenes being so contrived that they were never brought
on the stage together—in the same manner as in our farce of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Three and the Deuce</span></span>, where the idea of giving different characters
and manners to the three brothers, with a perfect
personal resemblance, by creating still greater astonishment
in their friends and acquaintances, seems an agreeable addition.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Menæchmi</span></span> was translated into English towards the end
of the sixteenth century, by William Warner, the author of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Albion’s England</span></span>. This version, which was first printed in
1595, and is entitled, <span class="tei tei-q">“Menæchmi, a pleasaunt and fine conceited
comedy, taken out of the most excellent wittie poet
Plautus, chosen purposely, as least harmefull, yet most delightful,”</span>
was unquestionably the origin of Shakspeare’s <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Comedy
of Errors</span></span>. The resemblance of the two Antipholis’, and the
other circumstances which give rise to the intrigue, are nearly
the same as in Plautus. Some of the mistakes, too, which
occur on the arrival of Antipholis of Syracuse at Ephesus,
have been suggested by the Latin play. Thus, the Syracusan,
on coming to Ephesus, dines with his brother’s wife. This
lady had under repair, at the goldsmith’s, a valuable chain,
which her husband resolves to present to his mistress, but the
goldsmith gives it to the Syracusan. At length the Ephesian
is believed insane by his friends, who bring Doctor Pinch, a
conjurer, to exorcise him. Shakspeare has added the characters
of the twin Dromios, the servants of the Antipholis’s, who
have the same singular resemblance to each other as their
masters, which has produced such intricacy of plot that it is
hardly possible to unravel the incidents.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Comedy of Errors</span></span> is accounted one of the earliest,
and is certainly one of the least happy efforts of Shakspeare’s
genius. I cannot agree with M. Schlegel, in thinking it
better than the Menæchmi of Plautus, or even than the best
modern imitation of that comedy—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Les Menechmes, ou Les
Jumeaux</span></span>, of the French poet Regnard, which is, at least, a
more lively and agreeable imitation. All the scenes, however,
have been accommodated to French manners; and the plot
differs considerably from that of Plautus, being partly formed
on an old French play of the same title, by Rotrou, which
appeared as early as 1636. One chief distinction is, that the
Chevalier Menechme knows of the arrival of his brother from
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page132">[pg 132]</span><a name="Pg132" id="Pg132" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the country, and knows that he had come to Paris in order to
receive an inheritance bequeathed to him by his uncle, as also
to marry a young lady of whom the Chevalier was enamoured.
The Chevalier avails himself of the resemblance to prosecute
his love-suit with the lady, and to receive the legacy from the
hands of an attorney, while his brother is in the meantime
harassed by women to whom the Chevalier had formerly paid
addresses, and is arrested for his debts. It was natural enough,
as in Plautus, that an infant, stolen and carried to a remote
country, should have transmitted no account of himself to his
family, and should have been believed by them to be dead;
but this can with difficulty be supposed of Regnard’s Chevalier,
who had not left his paternal home in Brittany till the
usual age for entering on military service, and had ever since
resided chiefly at Paris. The Chevalier finds, from letters
delivered to him by mistake, that his brother had come to
town to receive payment of a legacy recently bequeathed to
him: But, unless it was left to any one who bore the name of
Menechme, it is not easy to see how the attorney charged
with the payment, should have allowed himself to be duped
by the Chevalier. Nor is it likely that, suspicious as the elder
Menechme is represented, he should trust so much to his
brother’s valet, or allow himself to be terrified in the public
street and open day into payment of a hundred louis d’or. It
is equally improbable that Araminte should give up the Chevalier
to her niece, or that the elder Menechme should marry
the old maid merely to get back half the sum of which his
brother had defrauded him. That all the adventures, besides,
should terminate to the advantage of the Chevalier, has too
much an air of contrivance, and takes away that hazard which
ought to animate pieces of this description, and which excites
the interest in Plautus, where the incidents prove fortunate or
unfavourable indiscriminately to the two brothers.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In Plautus, the robe which Menæchmus of Epidamnum carries
off from his wife, suffices for almost the whole intrigue.
It alone brings into play the falsehood and avarice of the
courtezan, the inclination of both the Menæchmi for pleasure,
the gluttony of the parasite, and rage of the jealous
wife: But in the French <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Menechmes</span></span>,—trunks, letters, a portrait,
promises of marriage, and presents, are heaped on each
other, to produce accumulated mistakes. Regnard has also
introduced an agreeable variety, by discriminating the characters
of the brothers, between whom Plautus and Shakspeare
have scarcely drawn a shade of difference. The Chevalier
is a polished gentleman—very ingenious; but, I think,
not very honest: His brother is blunt, testy, and impatient,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page133">[pg 133]</span><a name="Pg133" id="Pg133" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and not very wise. The difference, indeed, in their language
and manners, is so very marked, that it seems hardly possible,
whatever might be the personal resemblance, that the Chevalier’s
mistress could have been deceived. These peculiarities
of disposition, however, render the mistakes, and the country
brother’s impatience under them, doubly entertaining—

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Miles Gloriosus</span></span>, (the Braggart Captain.) This was a character
of the new Greek comedy, introduced and brought to
perfection by Philemon and Menander. These dramatists
wrote during the reigns of the immediate successors of Alexander
the Great. At that period, his generals who had
established sovereignties in Syria and Egypt, were in the
practice of recruiting their armies by levying mercenaries in
Greece. The soldiers who had thus served in the wars of the
Seleucidæ and Ptolemies, were in the habit, when they re<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page134">[pg 134]</span><a name="Pg134" id="Pg134" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>turned home to Greece after their campaigns, of astonishing
their friends with fabulous relations of their exploits in distant
countries. Having been engaged in wars with which Athens
had no immediate concern or interest, these partizans met
with little respect or sympathy from their countrymen, and
their lies and bravadoes having made them detested in Athenian
    society<a id="noteref_250" name="noteref_250" href="#note_250"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">250</span></span></a>, they became the prototypes of that dramatic
character of which the constant attributes were the most
absurd vanity, stupidity, profusion, and cowardice. This
overcharged character, along with that of the slave and parasite,
were transferred into the dramas of Plautus, the faithful
mirrors of the new Greek comedy. The first act of the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Miles Gloriosus</span></span> has little to do with the plot: It only serves
to acquaint us with the character of the Captain Pyrgopolinices;
and it is for this purpose alone that Plautus has introduced
the parasite, who does not return to the stage after the
first scene. The boasts of this captain are quite extravagant,
but they are not so gross as the flatteries of the parasite:
indeed it is not to be conceived that any one could swallow
such compliments as that he had broken an elephant’s thigh
with his fist, and slaughtered seven thousand men in one day,
or that he should not have perceived the sarcasms of the
parasite intermixed with his fulsome flattery. Previous, however,
to the invention of gunpowder, more could be performed
in war by the personal prowess of individuals, than can be
now accomplished; and hence the character of the braggart
captain may not have appeared quite so exaggerated to the
ancients as it seems to us. One man of peculiar strength and
intrepidity often carried dismay into the hostile squadrons, as
Goliah defied all the armies of Israel, and, with a big look,
and a few arrogant words, struck so great a terror, that the
host fled before him.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Most European nations being imbued with military habits
and manners for many centuries after their first rise, the part
of a boasting coward was one of the broadest, and most obviously
humorous characters, that could be presented to the
spectators. Accordingly, the braggart Captain, though he
has at length disappeared, was one of the most notorious personages
on the early Italian, French, and English stage.

This military poltroon long kept possession of the Italian
stage, under the appellations of Capitan Spavento and Spezzafer,
till about the middle of the sixteenth century, when he
yielded his place to the Capitano Spagnuolo, whose business
was to utter Spanish rodomontades, to kick out the native
Italian Captain in compliment to the Spaniards, and then
quietly accept of a drubbing from Harlequin. When the
Spaniards had entirely lost their influence in Italy, the Capitan
Spagnuolo retreated from the stage, and was succeeded
by that eternal poltroon, Scaramuccio, a character which was

In imitation of the Italian captain, the early French dramatists

this character in Don Gaspard de Padille, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Fanfaron</span></span>, as
he is called, of the comedy <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Jodelet Duelliste</span></span>. Gaspard, however,
is not a very important or prominent character of the
piece. Jodelet himself, the valet of Don Felix, seems intended
as a burlesque or caricature of all the braggarts who had preceded
him. Having received a blow, he is ever vowing vengeance
against the author of the injury in his absence, but on
his appearance, suddenly becomes tame and submissive.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The braggart captains of the old English theatre have
much greater merit than the utterers of these nonsensical
rhapsodies of the French stage. Falstaff has been often considered
as a combination of the characters of the parasite and
Miles Gloriosus; but he has infinitely more wit than either;
and the liberty of fiction in which he indulges, is perhaps
scarcely more than is necessary for its display. His cheerfulness
and humour are of the most characteristic and captivating
sort, and instead of suffering that contumely with
which the parasite and Miles Gloriosus are loaded, laughter
and approbation attend his greatest excesses. His boasting
speeches are chiefly humorous; jest and merriment account
for most of them, and palliate them all. It is only subsequent
to the robbery that he discovers the traits of a Miles Gloriosus.
Most of the ancient braggarts bluster and boast of distant
wars, beyond the reach of knowledge or evidence—of exploits
performed in Persia and Armenia—of storms and stratagems—of
falling pell-mell on a whole army, and putting thousands
to the sword, till, by some open and apparent fact, they are
brought to shame as cowards and liars; but Falstaff’s boasts
refer to recent occurrences, and he always preserves himself
from degradation by the address with which he defies detection,
and extricates himself from every difficulty. His character,
however, in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Merry Wives of Windsor</span></span>, has some
affinity to the captains of the Roman stage, from his being
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page137">[pg 137]</span><a name="Pg137" id="Pg137" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>constantly played on in consequence of his persuasion that
women are in love with him. The swaggering Pistol in
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">King Henry IV.</span></span>, is chiefly characterized by his inflated language,
and is, as Doll calls him, merely <span class="tei tei-q">“a fustian rascal.”</span>
Bessus, in Beaumont and Fletcher’s <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">King and No King</span></span>, is
said by Theobald to be a copy of Falstaff; but he has little
or none of his humour. Bessus was an abusive wretch, and
so much contemned, that no one called his words in question;
but, afterwards, while flying in battle, having accidentally
rushed on the enemy, he acquired a reputation for valour;
and being now challenged to combat by those whom he had
formerly traduced, his great aim is to avoid fighting, and yet
to preserve, by boasting, his new character for courage.
However fine the scene between Bessus and Arbaces, at the
conclusion of the third act, the darker and more infamous
shades of character there portrayed ought not to have been
delineated, as our contemptuous laughter is converted, during
the rest of the play, or, on a second perusal, into detestation
and horror. Bobadil, in Ben Jonson’s <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Every Man in his
Humour</span></span>, has generally been regarded as a copy of the Miles
Gloriosus; but the late editor of Jonson thinks him a creation
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sui generis</span></span>, and perfectly original. <span class="tei tei-q">“The soldiers of the
Roman stage,”</span> he continues, <span class="tei tei-q">“have not many traits in common
with Bobadil. Pyrgopolinices, and other captains with hard
names, are usually wealthy—all of them keep mistresses, and
some of them parasites—but Bobadil is poor. They are profligate
and luxurious—but Bobadil is stained with no inordinate
vice, and is so frugal, that a bunch of radishes, and a
pipe to close the orifice of his stomach, satisfy all his wants.
Add to this, that the vanity of the ancient soldier is accompanied
with such deplorable stupidity, that all temptation
to mirth is taken away, whereas Bobadil is really amusing.
His gravity, which is of the most inflexible nature, contrasts
admirably with the situations into which he is thrown; and
though beaten, baffled, and disgraced, he never so far forgets
himself as to aid in his own discomfiture. He has no soliloquies,
like Bessus and Parolles, to betray his real character,
and expose himself to unnecessary contempt: nor does he
break through the decorum of the scene in a single instance.
He is also an admirer of poetry, and seems to have a pretty
taste for criticism, though his reading does not appear very
extensive; and his decisions are usually made with somewhat
too much promptitude. In a word, Bobadil has many distinguishing
traits, and, till a preceding braggart shall be discovered,
with something more than big words and beating, to
characterize him, it may not be amiss to allow Jonson the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page138">[pg 138]</span><a name="Pg138" id="Pg138" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>credit of having depended on his own resources.”</span> The character
of the braggart captain was continued in the Bernardo
of Shadwell’s <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Amorous Bigot</span></span>, and Nol Bluff, in Congreve’s <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Old
Bachelor</span></span>. These are persons who apparently would destroy
every thing with fire and sword; but their mischief is only in
their words, and they <span class="tei tei-q">“will not swagger with a Barbary hen,
if her feathers turn back with any show of resistance.”</span> The
braggarts, indeed, of modern dramatists, have been universally
represented as cowardly, from Spampana down to Captain
Flash. But cowardice is not a striking attribute of the
Miles Gloriosus of Plautus, at least it is not made the principal
source of ridicule as with the moderns. We have instead, a
vain conceit of his person, and his conviction that every woman
is in love with him.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This feature in the character of the Miles Gloriosus, produces
a principal part in the intrigue of this amusing drama,
which properly commences at the second act, and is said, in
a prologue there introduced, to have been taken from the
Greek play <span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-family: Gentium, 'New Athena Unicode', 'DejaVu Serif', 'Lucida Grande', 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Palatino Linotype', serif">Αλαζων</span></span>. While residing at Athens, the captain had
purchased from her mother a young girl, (whose lover was at
that time absent on an embassy,) and had brought her with
him to his house at Ephesus. The lover’s slave entered into
the captain’s service, and, seeing the girl in his possession,
wrote to his former master, who, on learning the fate of his
mistress, repaired to Ephesus. There he went to reside with
Periplectomenes, a merry old bachelor, who had been a friend
of his father, and now agreed to assist him in recovering the
object of his affections. The house of Periplectomenes being
immediately adjacent to that of the captain, the ingenious
slave dug an opening between them; and the keeper, who had
been intrusted by the captain with charge of the damsel, was
thus easily persuaded by her rapid, and to him unaccountable,
transition from one building to the other, that it was a twin
sister, possessing an extraordinary resemblance to her, who
had arrived at the house of Periplectomenes. Afterwards, by
a new contrivance, a courtezan is employed to pretend that
she is the wife of Periplectomenes, and to persuade the captain
that she is in love with him. To facilitate this amour, he
allows the girl, whom he had purchased at Athens, to depart
with her twin sister and her lover, who had assumed the character
of the master of the vessel in which she sailed. The
captain afterwards goes to the house of Periplectomenes to a
supposed assignation, where he is seized and beat, but does
not discover how completely he had been duped, till the
Athenian girl had got clear off with her lover.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This play must, in the representation, have been one of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page139">[pg 139]</span><a name="Pg139" id="Pg139" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>most amusing of its author’s productions. The scenes are full
of action and bustle, while the secret communication between
the two houses occasions many lively incidents, and forms an
excellent <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">jeu de theatre</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
With regard to the characters, the one which gives title to
the play is, as already mentioned, quite extravagant; and no
modern reader can enjoy the rodomontade of the Miles Gloriosus,
or his credulity in listening with satisfaction to such
monstrous tales of his military renown and amorous success.
Flattery for potential qualities may be swallowed to any extent,
and a vain man may wish that others should be persuaded that
he had performed actions of which he is incapable; but no
man can himself hearken with pleasure to falsehoods which
he knows to be such, and which in the recital are not intended
to impose upon others. Pleusides, the lover in this drama, is
totally insipid and uninteresting, and we are not impressed
with a very favourable opinion of his mistress from the account
which is given of her near the beginning of the play:—

The principal character, the one which is best supported, and
which is indeed sustained with considerable humour, is that
of Periplectomenes, who is an agreeable old man, distinguished
by his frankness, jovial disposition, and abhorrence of matrimony.
There is one part of his conduct, however, which I
wish had been omitted, as it savours too much of cunning, and
reminds us too strongly of Ben Jonson’s Volpone. Talking of
his friends and relations, he says—

I have often thought that the character of Durazzo, in Massinger’s
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Guardian</span></span>, was formed on that of Periplectomenes.
Like him, Durazzo is a jovial old bachelor, who aids his nephew
Caldoro in his amour with Calista. When the lover in
Plautus apologizes to his friend for having engaged him in an
enterprize so unsuitable to his years, he replies—

It may be perhaps considered as a confirmation of the above
conjecture concerning Massinger’s imitation of Plautus, that
the cook in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Guardian</span></span> is called Cario, which is also the
name of the cook of Periplectomenes.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is, however, a coincidence connected with this drama
of Plautus, which is much more curious and striking than its
resemblance to the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Guardian</span></span> of Massinger. The plot of the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Miles Gloriosus</span></span> is nearly the same with the story of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Two
Dreams</span></span> related in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Seven Wise Masters</span></span>, a work originally
written by an Indian philosopher, long before the Christian
æra, and which, having been translated into Greek under the
title of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Syntipas</span></span>, became current during the dark ages through
all the countries of Europe, by the different names of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dolopatos</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Erastus</span></span>, and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Seven Wise Masters</span></span>,—the frame remaining
substantially the same, but the stories being frequently
adapted to the manners of different nations. In this popular
story-book the tale of the Two Dreams concerns a knight, and
a lady who was constantly confined by a jealous husband, in
a tower almost inaccessible. Having become mutually enamoured,
in consequence of seeing each other in dreams, the
knight repaired to the residence of the husband, by whom he
was hospitably received, and was at length allowed to build a
habitation on his possessions, at no great distance from the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page141">[pg 141]</span><a name="Pg141" id="Pg141" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>castle in which his wife was inclosed. When the building
was completed, the knight secretly dug a communication
under ground, between his new dwelling and the tower, by
which means he enjoyed frequent and uninterrupted interviews
with the object of his passion. At length the husband
was invited to an entertainment prepared at the knight’s residence,
at which his wife was present, and presided in the
character of the knight’s mistress. During the banquet the
husband could not help suspecting that she was his wife, and
in consequence he repaired, after the feast was over, to the
tower, where he found her sitting composedly in her usual
dress. This, and his confidence in the security of the tower,
the keys of which he constantly kept in his pocket, dispelled
his suspicions, and convinced him that the Beauty who had
done the honours of the knight’s table, had merely a striking
resemblance to his own lovely consort. Being thus gradually
accustomed to meet her at such entertainments, he at last
complied with his friend’s request, and kindly assisted at the
ceremony of the knight’s marriage with his leman. After their
union, he complacently attended them to the harbour, and
handed the lady to the vessel which the knight had prepared
for the elopement. This story also coincides with Le Chevalier
    a la Trappe, one of the Fabliaux of the Norman Trouveurs<a id="noteref_252" name="noteref_252" href="#note_252"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">252</span></span></a>,
with a tale in the fourth part of the Italian <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Novellino</span></span> 
of Massuccio Salernitano, and with the adventures of the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vieux Calender</span></span>, in Gueulette’s <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Contes Tartares</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Mercator</span></span>—is one of the plays for which Plautus was indebted
to Philemon, the contemporary and the successful rival of
Menander, over whom he usually triumphed by the theatrical
suffrages, while contending for the prize of comedy. The
Roman critics unanimously concur in representing these
popular decisions as unjust and partial. But Quintilian, while
he condemns the perverted judgment of those who preferred
Philemon to Menander, acknowledges that he must be universally
admitted to have merited the next place to his great
rival.—<span class="tei tei-q">“Qui ut pravis sui temporis judiciis Menandro sæpe
    prælatus est, ita consensu tamen omnium meruit credi secundus<a id="noteref_253" name="noteref_253" href="#note_253"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">253</span></span></a>.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
An interesting account of Philemon is given in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Observer</span></span>, 
by Cumberland, who has also collected the strange and inconsistent
stories concerning the manner of his death. He is
represented to us as having been a man of amiable character,
and cheerful disposition, seldom agitated by those furious
passions which distracted the mind of Menander. He lived
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page142">[pg 142]</span><a name="Pg142" id="Pg142" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to the extraordinary age of a hundred and one, during which
long period he wrote ninety comedies. Of these, the critics
and grammarians have preserved some fragments, which are
generally of a tender and sentimental, sometimes even of a
plaintive cast. Apuleius, however, informs us, that Philemon
was distinguished for the happiest strokes of wit and humour,
for the ingenious disposition of his plots, for his striking and
well managed discoveries, and the admirable adaptation of
    his characters to their situations in life<a id="noteref_254" name="noteref_254" href="#note_254"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">254</span></span></a>. To judge by the
Latin Mercator, imitated or translated from the <span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-family: Gentium, 'New Athena Unicode', 'DejaVu Serif', 'Lucida Grande', 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Palatino Linotype', serif">Εμπορος</span></span> of
Philemon, it is impossible not to consider him as inferior to
those other Greek dramatists from whom Plautus borrowed his
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Amphitryon</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Aulularia</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Casina</span></span>, and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Miles Gloriosus</span></span>; yet it
must be recollected, that those are the best comedies which
suffer most by a transfusion into another language. The
English Hypocrites and Misers would indeed be feeble records
of the genius of Moliere. Of one point, however, we may
clearly judge, even through the mist of translation. Notwithstanding
what is said by Apuleius concerning the purity of
Philemon’s dramas, in none of the plays of Plautus is greater
moral turpitude represented. A son is sent abroad by his
father, with the view of reclaiming him from the dissolute
course of life which he had followed. The youth, however,
is so little amended by his travels, that he brings a mistress
home in the ship with him. The father, seeing the girl, falls
in love with her. His son, in order to conceal his passion,
proposes to sell its object, but engages one of his acquaintances
to purchase her for him. By some mismanagement,
she is bought by a friend whom the father had employed for
this purpose, and is carried, as had been previously arranged,
to the purchaser’s house. The friend’s wife, however, being
jealous of this inmate, her husband is obliged to explain matters
for her satisfaction, and the old debauchee, in consequence,
incurs, before the conclusion of the comedy, merited
shame and reproach.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
An old libertine may be a very fit subject for satire and
ridicule, but in this play there is certainly too much latitude
allowed to the debaucheries of youth. The whole moral of
the drama is contained in three lines near the conclusion:—
</p>

<div class="tei tei-lg" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em; margin-left: 2.00em; margin-top: 1.00em">

Nothing can be more ridiculous than the delays and trifling

extravagance, partly by his inordinate love for a courtezan,
and partly by the evil counsels of one of his slaves, called
Tranio. During an entertainment, which the youth is one

the accounts which Tranio brings, of the unexpected return
of the old man, whom he had just seen landing near the harbour.
At the same time, however, the slave undertakes to
prevent his entering the house. In prosecution of this design
he there locks up his young master and his guests, and, on the
approach of the old gentleman, gravely informs him that the
house was now shut up, in consequence of being haunted by
the apparition of an unfortunate man, long since murdered in
it by the person from whom it had been last purchased. Tranio
has scarcely prevailed on the father to leave the door of
the dwelling, when they unluckily meet a money-lender, who
had come to crave payment of a large debt from the profligate
son; but the ingenious slave persuades the father, that the
money had been borrowed to pay for a house which was a
great bargain, and which his son had bought in place of that
which was haunted. A new dilemma, however, arises, from
the old gentleman’s asking to see the house: Tranio artfully
obtains leave from the owner, who being obliged to go to the
Forum, nothing is said on this occasion with regard to the
sale. He examines the house a second time along with the
owner, but Tranio had previously begged him, as from motives
of delicacy, to say nothing concerning his purchase; and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page144">[pg 144]</span><a name="Pg144" id="Pg144" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the whole passes as a visit, to what is called a Show-house.
The old man highly approves of the bargain; but at length
the whole deception is discovered, by his accidentally meeting
an attendant of one of his son’s companions, who is just going
into the haunted house to conduct his master home from that
scene of festivity. He has thus occasion to exercise all his
patience and clemency in forgiveness of the son by whom he
has been almost ruined, and of the slave by whom he had
been so completely duped.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In this play, the character of the young man might have
been rendered interesting, had it been better brought out;
but it is a mere sketch. He is a grave and serious character,
hurried into extravagance by bad example, evil counsel, and
one fatal passion. A long soliloquy, in which he compares
human life to a house, reminds us, in its tone of feeling and sentiment,
of <span class="tei tei-q">“All the world’s a stage.”</span> The father seems a great
deal too foolish and credulous, and the slave must have relied
much on his weakness, when he ventured on such desperate
expedients, and such palpable lies. Slaves, it will already
have been remarked, are principal characters in many of the
dramas of Plautus; and a curious subject of inquiry is presented
in their insolence, effrontery, triumphant roguery, and
habitual familiarity with their masters at one moment, while
at the next they are threatened with the lash or crucifixion.
In Athens, however, where the prototype of this character
was found, the slave was treated by his master with much
more indulgence than the Spartan Helot, or any other slaves
in Greece. The masters themselves, who were introduced on
the ancient stage, were not in the first ranks of society; and
the vices which required the assistance of their slaves reduced
them to an equality. Besides, an Athenian or Roman master
could hardly be displeased with the familiarity of those who
were under such complete subjection; and the striking contrast
of their manners and situation would render their sallies
as poignant as the spirited remarks of Roxalana in the seraglio
of the Sultan. The character, too, gave scope for
those jests and scurrilities, which seem to have been indispensable
ingredients in a Roman comedy, but which would
be unsuitable in the mouths of more dignified persons. They
were, in fact, the buffoons of the piece, who avowed without
scruple their sensual inclinations and want of conscience;
for not only their impudence, but their frauds and deceptions,
seem to have been highly relished by the spectators. It is
evident that both the Greeks and Romans took peculiar pleasure
in seeing a witty slave cheat a covetous master, and that
the ingenuity of the fraud was always thought sufficient
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page145">[pg 145]</span><a name="Pg145" id="Pg145" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>atonement for its knavery. Perhaps this unfortunate class of
men derived so few advantages from society, that they were
considered as entitled, at least on the stage, to break through
its ties. The character of a saucy and impudent slave had
been already portrayed in the old Greek comedy. In the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Plutus</span></span> of Aristophanes, Carion, the slave of Chremylus, is the
most prominent character, and is distinguished by freedom of
remark and witty impudence. To these attributes there was
added, in the new comedy, a spirit of roguery and intrigue:
and in this form the character was almost universally adopted
by the Latin dramatists. The slaves of Plautus correspond
to the valets—the Crispins, and Merlins of the French theatre,
whose race commenced with Merlin, in Scarron’s <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Marquis
Ridicule</span></span>. They were also introduced in Moliere’s earliest
pieces, but not in his best; and were in a great measure
dropped by his successors, as, in fact, they had ceased to be
the spring of any important event or intrigue in the world.
Indeed, I agree with M. Schlegel, in doubting if they could
ever have been introduced as happily on the modern as the
ancient stage. A wretch who was born in servitude, who was
abandoned for life to the capricious will of a master, and was
thus degraded below the dignity of man, might excite laughter
instead of indignation, though he did not conform to the
strictest precepts of honesty. He was placed in a state of
warfare with his oppressor, and cunning became his natural
arms.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The French dramatist who has employed the character of
the intriguing valet to most advantage, is Regnard; to whom,
among many other agreeable pieces, we are indebted for a
delightful imitation of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Mostellaria</span></span> of Plautus, entitled, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Le
Retour Imprevu, comedie en prose, et en une acte</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In this play, the incidents of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Mostellaria</span></span> have been in
general adopted, though they have been somewhat transposed.
We have the imposture of Merlin, who corresponds
with Plautus’s Tranio, as to the haunted house, and his subterfuge
when the usurer comes to claim the money which he
had lent. In place, however, of asking to see the new house,
the father proposes to deposit some merchandise in it. Merlin
then persuades him, that the lady to whom it formerly
belonged, and who had not yet quitted it, was unfortunately
deprived of reason, and, having been in consequence interdicted
by her relations from the use of her property, the house
had been exposed to sale. At the same time, the artful valet
finds an opportunity of informing the real owner, that the old
man had gone mad in consequence of having lost all his merchandise
at sea. Accordingly, when they meet, neither of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page146">[pg 146]</span><a name="Pg146" id="Pg146" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>them pays the smallest attention to what each considers the
raving of the other. Instead of a courtezan, Regnard has introduced
a young lady, with whom Clitandre is in love; but
he has given her the manners rather of a courtezan, than a
young lady. There is one incident mentioned in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Mostellaria</span></span>
which is omitted in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Retour Imprevu</span></span>, and of which
even Plautus has not much availed himself, though it might
have been enlarged on, and improved to advantage: the old
man mentions, that he had met the person from whom he had
bought the haunted house, and that he had taxed him with
the murder of his guest, whose apparition still walked, but
that he had stoutly denied the charge.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Fantasmi</span></span> of Ercole Bentivoglio, an Italian comedy of
the sixteenth century, is formed on the same original as the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Retour Imprevu</span></span>. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Mostellaria</span></span> has likewise suggested the
plot of an old tragi-comedy by Heywood, printed in 1633,
and entitled <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The English Traveller</span></span>. Fielding’s <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Intriguing
Chambermaid</span></span> is also derived from the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Mostellaria</span></span>, but
through the medium of Regnard’s comedy. Indeed, it may
be considered as almost a translation from the French; except
that the author has most absurdly assigned the part of
the Latin Tranio, and French Merlin, to a chambermaid,
whom he calls Mrs Lettice, and has added a great number of
songs and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">double entendres</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It has been said, that the last act of Ben Johnson’s <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Alchemist</span></span>,
where Face, in order to conceal the iniquities committed
in his master’s house during his absence, tries to persuade
him, that it was shut up on account of being visited by an
    apparition, has been suggested by the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Mostellaria</span></span><a id="noteref_255" name="noteref_255" href="#note_255"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">255</span></span></a>; but, as
there is no resemblance between the two plays in other incidents,
we cannot be assured that the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Mostellaria</span></span> was at all
in the view of the great English dramatist.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Persa</span></span>.—In this play, which belongs to the lowest order of
comedy, the characters are two slaves, a foot-boy of one of
these slaves, a parasite, a pander, and a courtezan, with her
waiting-maid. The manners represented are such as might
be expected from this respectable group. The incidents are
few and slight, hinging almost entirely on a deceit practised
against the pander, who is persuaded to give a large sum for
a free woman, whom the slaves had dressed up as an Arabian
captive, and whom he was obliged to relinquish after having
paid the money. The fable is chiefly defective from the trick
of the slaves being intended to serve their own purposes.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page147">[pg 147]</span><a name="Pg147" id="Pg147" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>But such devices are interesting only when undertaken for
the advantage of higher characters; a comedy otherwise must
degenerate into farce.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pœnulus</span></span>, (the Carthaginian,) is one of the longest, and, I
think, on the whole, the dullest of Plautus’ performances. It
turns on the discovery of a lost child, who had been stolen
from her Carthaginian parents in infancy, and had been carried
to Greece. In none of those numerous plays which turn
on the recognition of lost children, has Plautus ever exhibited
an affecting interview, or even hit on an expression of natural
tenderness. The characters are either not brought on the
stage at the conclusion, and we are merely told by some slave
or parasite that the discovery had taken place: or, as in the
instance of Hanno and his daughter in the present drama, the
parties most interested teaze and torment each other with
absurd questions, instead of giving way to any species of
emotion. It is a high example, however, of the noble and
generous spirit of the Romans, that Hanno, the Carthaginian
introduced in this play, which was represented in the course
of the Punic wars, is more amiable than almost any other
character in Plautus. It is evident, from his quibbles and
obscene jests, that the Latin dramatist adapted his plays to
the taste of the vulgar; and if the picture of a villainous or
contemptible Carthaginian could have pleased the Roman
public, as the Jew of Malta gratified the prejudices of an
English mob, Plautus would not have hesitated to accommodate
himself to such feelings, and his Hanno would doubtless
have appeared in those hateful colours in which the Jews, or
in that ridiculous light in which the French, have usually been
exhibited on the British stage.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The employment of different dialects, or idioms, which has
been so great a resource of the modern comic muse, particularly
on the Italian stage, had been early resorted to in Greece.
Aristophanes, in one of his comedies, introduced the jargon
of a woman of Lacedæmon, where the Doric dialect was
spoken in its rudest form. Plautus, in a scene of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pœnulus</span></span>,
has made his Carthaginian speak in his native language;
and as the Carthaginian tongue was but little known in Greece,
it may be presumed that this scene was invented by Plautus
himself.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Those remains of the Punic language which have been
preserved, (though probably a good deal corrupted,) are regarded
as curious vestiges of philological antiquity, and have
afforded ample employment for the critics, who have laboured
to illustrate and restore them to the right readings. Commentators
have found in them traces of all the ancient tongues,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page148">[pg 148]</span><a name="Pg148" id="Pg148" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>according to their own fancy, or some favourite system they
had adopted. Joseph Scaliger considered them as little removed
    from the purity of original Hebrew<a id="noteref_256" name="noteref_256" href="#note_256"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">256</span></span></a>; and Pareus, in
his edition of Plautus, printed them in Hebrew characters, as
    did Bochart, in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phaleg et Canaan</span></span><a id="noteref_257" name="noteref_257" href="#note_257"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">257</span></span></a>. Others, from the
resemblance of single letters, or syllables, have found in different
    words the Chinese, Ethiopian, Persian, or Coptic dialects<a id="noteref_258" name="noteref_258" href="#note_258"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">258</span></span></a>. 
Plautus, it is well known, had considerable knowledge
of languages. Besides writing his own with the greatest
purity, he was well acquainted with Greek, Persian, and Punic.
The editor of the Delphin Plautus has a notable conjecture
on this point: He supposes that in the mill in which Plautus
laboured, (as if it had been a large mill on the modern construction,)
there was a Carthaginian, a Greek, and a Persian
slave, from whom alternately he acquired a knowledge of these
tongues in the hours of relaxation from work!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pseudolus</span></span>—is one of those plays of Plautus which hinge on
the contrivance of a slave in behalf of his young master, who
is represented at the commencement of the play, as in despair
at not having money sufficient to redeem his mistress, just then
sold by Ballio, a slave-dealer, to a Macedonian captain for
twenty <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">minæ</span></span>. Fifteen of these had been paid, and the girl
was to be delivered up to him as soon as he sent the remaining
five, along with an impression of a seal-ring, which the captain
had left behind as a pledge. Pseudolus, the slave, having
encountered the captain’s messenger, on his way to deliver a
letter containing the token and the balance of the stipulated
price, personates the pander’s servant, and is in consequence
intrusted with the letter. While the messenger is refreshing
himself at a tavern, Pseudolus persuades one of his fellow-slaves
to assume the character of the captain’s emissary, and
to present the credentials (which Pseudolus places in his
possession) to the pander, who immediately acknowledges
their authenticity, and, without hesitation, delivers up the girl
in return. When the real messenger afterwards arrives, the
slave-merchant treats him as an impostor hired by Pseudolus.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Next to the slave, the principal character in this comedy is
that of the pander, which is sketched with the strong pencil
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page149">[pg 149]</span><a name="Pg149" id="Pg149" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of a master, and is an admirable representation of that last
stage of human depravity and wretchedness, in which even
appearances cease to be preserved with the world, and there
exists no longer any feeling or anxiety concerning the opinion
of others. Calidorus, the lover of the girl, upbraids him for
his breach of faith—

M. Dacier, however, is of a different opinion with regard
to the merit of this character. He thinks that the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pseudolus</span></span>, 
though mentioned by Cato in Cicero’s Dialogue <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De Senectute</span></span>, 
    as a finished piece which greatly delighted its author<a id="noteref_259" name="noteref_259" href="#note_259"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">259</span></span></a>, and
though called, by one of his commentators, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ocellus Fabularum

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Epistles</span></span>, of Plautus’ want of success in the characters of a
young passionate lover, a parsimonious father, and a cunning
pimp,—

<div class="tei tei-lg" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em; margin-left: 2.00em; margin-top: 1.00em">

</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These three characters all occur in this comedy; and Dacier
maintains that they are very poorly supported by the poet.—Calidorus 
is a young lover, but his character (says the critic,)
is so cold and lifeless, that he hardly deserves the name. His
father, Simo, corresponds as little to the part of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Patris
attenti</span></span>; for he encourages the slave to deceive himself, and
promises him a recompense if he succeed in over-reaching
the slave-merchant, and placing in the hands of his son the
girl on whom he doated. Ballio, the slave-dealer, so far
from sustaining the character <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">lenonis insidiosi</span></span>, who should
deceive every one, very foolishly becomes the dupe of a lying
    valet<a id="noteref_261" name="noteref_261" href="#note_261"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">261</span></span></a>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The scene between Calidorus and the pander, from which
some lines are extracted above, and that by which it is preceded,
where Ballio gives directions to his slaves, seem to
have suggested two scenes in Sir Richard Steele’s comedy of
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Funeral</span></span>. The play has been more closely imitated by
Baptista Porta, the celebrated author of the Magia Naturalis
in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">La Trappolaria</span></span>, one of the numerous plays with the com<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page150">[pg 150]</span><a name="Pg150" id="Pg150" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>position of which he amused his leisure, after the mysteries
and chimeras of his chief work had excited the suspicion of
the court of Rome, and he was in consequence prohibited
from holding those assemblies of learned men, who repaired
to his house with their newly discovered secrets in medicine
and other arts. His play, which was first printed at Bergamo
in 1596, is much more complicated in its incidents than the
Latin original. Trappola, the Pseudolus of the piece, feigns
himself, as in Plautus, to be the pander’s slave, and persuades
a parasite to act the part of the pander himself: By this stratagem,
the parasite receives from the captain’s servant the
stipulated money and tokens, but delivers to him in return
his ugly wife Gabrina, as the Beauty he was to receive; and
there follows a comical scene, produced by the consequent
amazement and disappointment of the captain. The parasite
then personates the captain’s servant, and, by means of the
credentials of which he had possessed himself, obtains the
damsel Filesia, whom he carries to her lover. With this plot,
chiefly taken from Plautus, another series of incidents, invented
by the Italian dramatist, is closely connected. The father
of the young lover, Arsenio, had left his wife in Spain; and
also another son, who had married there, and exactly resembled
his brother in personal appearance. Arsenio being
ordered by his father to sail from Naples, where the scene is
laid, for Spain, in order to convey home his relatives in that
country, and being in despair at the prospect of this separation
from his mistress, the father is persuaded, by a device of
the cheat Trappola, that he had not proceeded on the voyage,
as his brother had already arrived. Availing himself of his
resemblance, Arsenio personates his Spanish brother, and
brings his mistress as his wife to his father’s house, where she
remains protected, in spite of the claims of the captain and
pander, till the whole artifice is discovered by the actual
arrival of the old lady from Spain. Arsenio’s mistress being
then strictly questioned, proves to be a near connection of the
family, who had been carried off in childhood by corsairs, and
she is now, with the consent of all, united to her lover.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is also a close imitation of the incidents of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pseudolus</span></span>
in Moliere’s <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Etourdi</span></span>, which turns on the stratagems of
a valet to place a girl in possession of his master Lelie. His
    first device, as already mentioned, was suggested by the Epidicus<a id="noteref_262" name="noteref_262" href="#note_262"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">262</span></span></a>;
but this having failed, he afterwards contrives to get
into the service of his master’s rival, Leander, who, having
purchased the girl from the proprietor, had agreed to send a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page151">[pg 151]</span><a name="Pg151" id="Pg151" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>ring as a token, at sight of which she was to be delivered up.
The valet receives the ring for this very purpose, carries it to
the owner, and by such means is just on the point of obtaining
possession of the girl, when his stratagem, as usual, is
defeated by the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">etourderie</span></span> of his master. This notion of the
valet’s best-laid plans being always counteracted, was probably
suggested by the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bacchides</span></span> of Plautus, where Mnesilochus
repeatedly frustrates the well-contrived schemes of his slave
Chrysalus; though, perhaps through the medium of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Inavertito</span></span>
of the Italian dramatist, Nicolo Barbieri, printed in
1629, or Quinault’s <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Amant Indiscret</span></span>, which was acted four
years before Moliere’s <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Etourdi</span></span>, and is founded on the same
plan with that drama. In the particular incidents the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Etourdi</span></span>
is compounded of the tricks of Plautus’ slaves; but Moliere has
shown little judgment in thus heaping them on each other in
one piece. Such events might occur once, but not six or
seven times, to the same person. In fact, the valet is more
of an <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Etourdi</span></span> than his master, as he never forewarns him of
his plans; and we feel as we advance, that the play could not
be carried on without a previous concert among the characters
to connive at impossibilities, and to act in defiance of all
common sense or discretion.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rudens</span></span>.—This play, which is taken from a Greek comedy
of Diphilus, has been called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rudens</span></span> by Plautus, from the rope
or cable whereby a fisherman drags to shore a casket which
chiefly contributes to the solution of the fable. In the prologue,
which is spoken by Arcturus, we are informed of the
circumstances which preceded the opening of the drama, and
the situation in which the characters were placed at its commencement.
Plautus has been frequently blamed by the
critics for the fulness of his preliminary expositions, as tending
to destroy the surprise and interest of the succeeding
scenes. But I think he has been unjustly censured, even with
regard to those prologues, where, as in that of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pœnulus</span></span>,
he has anticipated the incidents, and revealed the issue of the
plot. The comedies of Plautus were intended entirely for
exhibition on the public stage, and not for perusal in the
closet. The great mass of the Roman people in his age was
somewhat rude: They had not been long accustomed to dramatic
representations, and would have found it difficult to
follow an intricate plot without a previous exposition. This,
indeed, was not necessary in tragedies. The stories of Agamemnon
and Œdipus, with other mythical subjects, so frequently
dramatized by Ennius and Livius Andronicus, were
sufficiently known; and, as Dryden has remarked, <span class="tei tei-q">“the people,
as soon as they heard the name of Œdipus, knew as well as
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page152">[pg 152]</span><a name="Pg152" id="Pg152" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the poet that he had killed his father by mistake, and committed
incest with his mother; that they were now to hear of
    a great plague, an oracle, and the ghost of Laius<a id="noteref_263" name="noteref_263" href="#note_263"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">263</span></span></a>.”</span> It was
quite different, however, in those new inventions which formed
the subjects of comedies, and in which the incidents would
have been lost or misunderstood without some introductory
explanation. The attention necessary to unravel a plot prevents
us from remarking the beauties of sentiment or poetry,
and draws off our attention from humour or character, the
chief objects of legitimate comedy. We often read a new
play, or one with which we are not acquainted, before going
to see it acted. Surprise, which is everything in romance, is
the least part of the drama. Our horror at the midnight
murders of Macbeth, and our laughter at the falsehoods and
facetiousness of Falstaff, are not diminished, but increased,
by knowing the issue of the crimes of the one, and the genial
festivity of the other. In fact, the sympathy and pleasure so
often derived from our knowledge outweighs the gratification
of surprise. The Athenians were well aware that Jocasta, in
the celebrated drama of Sophocles, was the mother of Œdipus;
but the knowledge of this fact, so far from abating the
    concern of the spectators, as Dryden supposes<a id="noteref_264" name="noteref_264" href="#note_264"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">264</span></span></a>, must have
greatly contributed to increase the horror and interest excited
by the representation of that amazing tragedy. The celebrated
scene of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Iphigenia in Tauris</span></span>, between Electra and
Orestes, the masterpiece of poetic art and tragic pathos,
would lose half its effect if we were not aware that Orestes
was the brother of Electra, and if this were reserved as a discovery
to surprise the spectators. Indeed, so convinced of
all this were the Greek dramatists, that, in many of their plays,
as the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hecuba</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hippolytus</span></span> of Euripides, the issue of the
drama is announced at its commencement.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But, be this as it may, the prologue itself, which is prefixed
to the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rudens</span></span>, is eminently beautiful. Arcturus descends
as a star from heaven, and opens the piece, somewhat in the
manner of the Angel who usually delivers the prologue in the
ancient Italian mysteries—of the Mercury who frequently
recites it in the early secular dramas, and the Attendant Spirit
in the Masque of Comus, who, by way of prologue, declares
his office, and the mission which called him to earth. In a
manner more consistent with oriental than with either Greek
or Roman mythology, Arcturus represents himself as mingling
with mankind during day, in order to observe their actions,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page153">[pg 153]</span><a name="Pg153" id="Pg153" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and as presenting a record of their good and evil deeds to Jupiter,
whom the wicked in vain attempt to appease by sacrifice—

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Arcturus having thus satisfactorily accounted for his knowledge
of the incidents of the drama, proceeds to unfold the
situation of the principal characters. Dæmones, before whose
house in Cyrene the scene is laid, had formerly resided at
Athens, where his infant daughter had been kidnapped, and
had been afterwards purchased by a slave merchant, who
brought her to Cyrene. A Greek youth, then living in that
town, had become enamoured of her, and having agreed to
purchase her, the merchant had consented to meet him and
fulfil the bargain at an adjacent temple. But being afterwards
persuaded that he could procure a higher price for
her in Sicily, the slave-dealer secretly hired a vessel, and set
sail, carrying the girl along with him. The ship had scarcely
got out to sea when it was overtaken by a dreadful tempest
over which Arcturus is figured as presiding. The play opens
during the storm, in a manner eminently beautiful and romantic—an
excellence which none of the other plays of
Plautus possess. Dæmones and his servant are represented
as viewing the tempest from land, and pointing out to each
other the dangers and various vicissitudes of a boat, in which
were seated two damsels who had escaped from the ship, and
were trying to gain the shore, which, after many perils, they
at length reached. The decorations of this scene are said
to have been splendid, and disposed in a very <a name="corr153" id="corr153" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">picturesque</span>
manner. Madame Dacier conjectures, <span class="tei tei-q">“that at the farther
end of the stage was a prospect of the sea, intersected by
many rocks and cliffs, which projected considerably forward
on the stage. On one side the city of Cyrene was represented
as at a distance; on the other, the temple of Venus, with a
court before it, in the centre of which stood an altar. Adjacent
to the temple, and on the same side, was the house of
Dæmones, with some scattered cottages in the back ground.”</span>
Pleusidippus, the lover, comes forward to the temple during
the storm, and then goes off in search of Labrax, the slave-merchant,
who had likewise escaped from the shipwreck. The
damsels, whose situation is highly interesting, having now got
on shore, appear among the cliffs, and after having deplored
their misfortunes, they are received into the temple by the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page154">[pg 154]</span><a name="Pg154" id="Pg154" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>priestess of Venus, who reminds them, however, that they
should have come clothed in white garments and bringing
victims! Here they are discovered by the slave of Pleusidippus,
who goes to inform his master. Labrax then approaches
to the vicinity of the temple of Venus, and having
discovered that the damsels who had saved themselves from
the wreck were secreted there, he rushes in to claim and
seize them. Thus far the play is lively and well conducted,
but the subsequent scenes are too long protracted. They
are full of trifling, and are more loaded than those of any other
comedy of Plautus, with quaint conceits, the quibbling witticisms,
and the scurrilities of slaves. The scene in which
Labrax attempts to seize the damsels at the altar, and Dæmones
protects them, is insufferably tedious, but terminates at
length with the pander being dragged to prison. After this,
the fisherman of Dæmones is introduced, congratulating himself
on having found a wallet which had been lost from the
pander’s ship, and contained his money, as well as some
effects belonging to the damsels. The ridiculous schemes
which he proposes, and the future grandeur he anticipates in
consequence of his good fortune, is an excellent satire on the
fantastic projects of those who are elevated with a sudden
success. Having been observed, however, by the servant of
Pleusidippus, who suspected that this wallet contained articles
by which Palæstra might discover her parents, a long
contest for its possession ensues between them, which might
be amusing in the representation, but is excessively tiresome
in perusal. This may be also remarked of the scene where
their dispute is referred to the arbitration of Dæmones, who
apparently is chosen umpire for no other reason than because
this was necessary to unravel the plot. Dæmones discovers,
from the contents of the wallet, that Palæstra is his daughter.
The principal interest being thus exhausted, the remaining
scenes become more and more tedious. We feel no great
sympathy with the disappointment of the fisherman, and take
little amusement in the bargain which he drives with the
pander for the restoration of the gold, or his stipulation with
his master for a reward, on account of the important service
he had been instrumental in rendering him.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This play has been imitated by Ludovico Dolce, in his comedy
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Il Ruffiano</span></span>, which was published in 1560, and which,
the author says in his prologue, was <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vestita di habito antico,
e ridrizzato alla forma moderna</span></span>.”</span> The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ruffiano</span></span> is not a mere
translation from the Latin: the language and names are altered,
and the scenes frequently transposed. There is likewise
introduced the additional character of the old man <a name="corr154" id="corr154" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">Lucretio,</span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page155">[pg 155]</span><a name="Pg155" id="Pg155" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>father to the lover; also his lying valet Tagliacozzo, and his
jealous wife Simona. Lucretio comes from Venice to the
town where the scene of the play is laid, to recover a son who
had left home in quest of a girl in the possession of Secco the
Ruffiano. The first act is occupied with the details of Lucretio’s
family misfortunes, and it is only in the commencement
of the second act that the shipwreck and escape of the damsels
are introduced, so that the play opens in a way by no means
so interesting and picturesque as the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rudens</span></span> of Plautus. The
women having taken refuge in a church, Lucretio offers them
shelter in his own house, which exposes them to the rage of
his jealous wife Simona. By the assistance, however, of one
of these girls, he discovers his lost son, who was her lover;
and the recognition of the damsel herself as daughter of Isidoro,
who corresponds to the Dæmones of Plautus, is then
brought about in the same manner as in the Latin original, and
gives rise to the same tedious and selfish disputes among the
inferior characters. Madame Riccoboni has also employed
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rudens</span></span> in her comedy <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Le Naufrage</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Stichus</span></span>—is so called from a slave, who is a principal character
in the comedy. The subject is the continued determination
of two ladies to persist in their constancy to their husbands,
who, from their long absence, without having been
heard of, were generally supposed to be dead. In this resolution
they remain firm, in spite of the urgency of their fathers
to make them enter into second marriages, till at length their
conjugal fidelity is rewarded by the safe arrival of their consorts.
It would appear that Plautus had not found this subject
sufficient to form a complete play; he has accordingly
filled up the comic part of the drama with the carousal of
Stichus and his fellow slaves, and the stratagems of the parasite
Gelasimus, in order to be invited to the entertainments
which the husbands prepared in honour of their return.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Trinummus</span></span>—is taken from the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Thesaurus</span></span> of Philemon;
but Plautus has changed the original title into Trinummus—a
jocular name given to himself by one of the characters hired
to carry on a deception, for which he had received three pieces
of money, as his reward. The prologue is spoken by two
allegorical personages, Luxury, and her daughter Want, the
latter of whom had been commissioned by her mother to take
up her residence in the house of the prodigal youth Lesbonicus.
The play is then opened by a Protatick person, as he is called,
who comes to chide his friend Callicles for behaviour which
appeared to him in some points incomprehensible; in consequence
of which the person accused explains his conduct at
once to the spectators and his angry monitor. It seems Char<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page156">[pg 156]</span><a name="Pg156" id="Pg156" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>mides, an Athenian, being obliged to leave his own country
on business of importance, intrusted the guardianship of his
son and daughter to his friend Callicles. He had also confided
to him the management of his affairs, particularly the care of
a treasure which was secreted in a concealed part of his dwelling.
Lesbonicus, the son of Charmides, being a dissolute
youth, had put up the family mansion to sale, and his guardian,
in order that the treasure entrusted to him might not pass into
other hands, had purchased the house at a low price. Meanwhile
a young man, called Lysiteles, had fallen in love with
the daughter of Charmides, and obtained the consent of her
brother to his marriage. Her guardian was desirous to give
her a portion from the treasure, but does not wish to reveal
the secret to her extravagant brother. The person calling himself
Trinummus is therefore hired to pretend that he had come
as a messenger from the father—to present a forged letter to
the son and to feign that he had brought home money for the
daughter’s portion. While Trinummus is making towards the
house, to commence performance of his part, Charmides arrives
unexpectedly from abroad, and seeing this Counterfeit
approaching his house, immediately accosts him. A highly
comic scene ensues, in which the hireling talks of his intimacy
with Charmides, and also of being entrusted with his letters
and money; and when Charmides at length discovers himself,
he treats him as an impostor. The entrance of Charmides into
his house is the simple solution of this plot, of which the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">nodus</span></span> 
is neither very difficult nor ingenious. This meagre subject
is filled up with an amicable contest between Lesbonicus and
his sister’s lover, concerning her portion,—the latter generously
offering to take her without dowry, and the former refusing
to give her away on such ignominious terms.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The English translators of Plautus have remarked, that the
art of the dramatist in the conduct of this comedy is much to
be admired:—<span class="tei tei-q">“The opening of it,”</span> they observe, <span class="tei tei-q">“is highly
interesting; the incidents naturally arise from each other, and
the whole concludes happily with the reformation of Lesbonicus,
and the marriage of Lysiteles. It abounds with excellent
moral reflections, and the same may be said of it with
equal justice as of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Captives</span></span>:—</span>

</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On the other hand, none of Plautus’ plays is more loaded with
improbabilities of that description into which he most readily
falls. Thus Stasimus, the slave of Lesbonicus, in order to
save a farm which his master proposed giving as a portion to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page157">[pg 157]</span><a name="Pg157" id="Pg157" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>his sister, persuades the lover’s father that a descent to Acheron
opened from its surface,—that the cattle which fed on it fell
sick,—and that the owners themselves, after a short period,
invariably died or hanged themselves. In order to introduce
the scene between Charmides and the Counterfeit, the former,
though just returned from a sea voyage and a long absence,
waits in the street, on the appearance of a stranger, merely
from curiosity to know his business; and in the following scene
the slave Stasimus, after expressing the utmost terror for the
lash on account of his tarrying so long, still loiters to propound
a series of moral maxims, inconsistent with his character
and situation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The plot of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dowry</span></span> of Giovam-maria Cecchi is precisely
the same with that of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Trinummus</span></span>; but that dramatist
possessed a wonderful art of giving an air of originality to his
closest imitations, by the happy adaptation of ancient subjects
to Italian manners. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tresor Caché</span></span> of Destouches is almost
translated from the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Trinummus</span></span>, only he has brought
forward on the stage Hortense, the Prodigal’s sister, and has
added the character of Julie, the daughter of the absent father’s
friend, of whom the Prodigal himself is enamoured. In
this comedy the character of the two youths are meant to be
contrasted, and are more strongly brought out in the imitation,
from both of them being in love. A German play, entitled
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Schatz</span></span>, by the celebrated dramatist Lessing, is also borrowed
from this Latin original. The scene, too, in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Trinummus</span></span>, between
Charmides and the counterfeit messenger, has given rise
to one in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Suppositi</span></span> of Ariosto, and through that medium
to another in Shakspeare’s <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Taming of the Shrew</span></span>, where, when
it is found necessary for the success of Lucentio’s stratagem at
Padua, that some one should personate his father, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pedant</span></span> 
is employed for this purpose. Meanwhile, the father himself
unexpectedly arrives at Padua, and a comical scene in consequence
passes between them.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Truculentus</span></span>—is so called from a morose and clownish
servant, who, having accompanied his master from the country
to Rome, inveighs against the depraved morals of that city,
and especially against Phronesium, the courtezan by whom his
master had been enticed. His churlish disposition, however,
is only exhibited in a single scene. On the sole other occasion
on which he is introduced, he is represented as having become
quite mild and affable. For this change no reason is assigned,
but it is doubtless meant to be understood that he had meanwhile
been soothed and wheedled by the arts of some courtezan.
The characters, however, of the Truculentus and his
rustic master, have little to do with the main plot of the drama,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page158">[pg 158]</span><a name="Pg158" id="Pg158" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>which is chiefly occupied with the fate of the lovers, whom
Phronesium enticed to their ruin. When she had consumed
the wealth of the infatuated Dinarchus, she lays her snares
for Stratophanes, the Babylonian captain, to whom she pretends
to have borne a son, in order that she may prey on him
with more facility. This drama is accordingly occupied with
her feigned pregnancy, her counterfeited solicitude, and her
search for a supposititious child, to which she persuades her
dupe that she had given birth, but which afterwards proves to
be the child of her former lover Dinarchus, by a young lady
to whom he had been betrothed.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the first act of this play an account is given of the mysteries
of a courtezan’s occupation, which, with a passage near
the commencement of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Mostellaria</span></span>, and a few fragments of
Alexis, a writer of the middle comedy, gives us some insight
into the practices by which they entrapped and seduced, their
lovers, by whom they appear to have been maintained in prodigious
state and splendour. In a play of Terence, one of the
characters, talking of the train of a courtezan, says,

</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Greek courtezan possessed attainments, which the more
virtuous of her sex were neither expected nor permitted to
acquire. On her the education which was denied to a spotless
woman, was carefully bestowed. To sing, to dance, to play
on the lyre and the lute, were accomplishments in which the
courtezan was, from her earliest years, completely instructed.
The habits of private life afforded ample opportunity for the
display of such acquirements, as the charm of convivial meetings
among the Greeks was thought imperfect, unless the
enjoyments were brightened by a display of the talents which
belonged exclusively to the Wanton. But though these refinements
alone were sufficient to excite the highest admiration
of the Greek youth, unaccustomed as they were to female
society, and often procured a splendid establishment for the
accomplished courtezan, some of that class embraced a much
wider range of education; and having added to their attainments
in the fine arts, a knowledge of philosophy and the
powers of eloquence, they became, thus trained and educated,
the companions of orators, statesmen, and poets. The arrival
of Aspasia at Athens is said to have produced a change in the
manners of that city, and to have formed a new and remark<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page159">[pg 159]</span><a name="Pg159" id="Pg159" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>able epoch in the history of society. The class to which she
belonged was of more political importance in Athens than in
any other state of Greece; and though I scarcely believe that
the Peloponnesian war had its origin in the wrongs of Aspasia,
the Athenian courtezans, with their various interests, were
often alluded to in grave political harangues, and they were
considered as part of the establishment of the state. Above
all, the comic poets were devoted to their charms, were conversant
with their manners, and often experienced their rapacity
and infidelity; for, being unable to support them in their
habits of expense, an opulent old man, or dissolute youth,
was in consequence frequently preferred. The passion of
Menander for Glycerium is well known, and Diphilus, from
whom Plautus borrowed his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rudens</span></span>, consorted with Gnathena,
celebrated as one of the most lively and luxurious of Athenian
    Charmers<a id="noteref_266" name="noteref_266" href="#note_266"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">266</span></span></a>. Accordingly, many of the plays of the new comedy
derive their names from celebrated courtezans; but it
does not appear, from the fragments which remain, that they
were generally represented in a favourable light, or in their
    meridian splendour of beauty and accomplishments<a id="noteref_267" name="noteref_267" href="#note_267"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">267</span></span></a>. In the
Latin plays, the courtezans are not drawn so highly gifted in
point of talents, or even beauty, as might be expected; but it
was necessary to paint them as elegant, fascinating, and expensive,
in order to account for the infatuation and ruin of
their lovers. The Greeks and Romans were alike strangers
to the polite gallantry of Modern Europe, and to the enthusiastic
love which chivalry is said to have inspired in the middle
ages. Thus their hearts and senses were left unprotected, to
become the prey of such women as the Phronesium of the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Truculentus</span></span>, who is a picture of the most rapacious and debauched
of her class, and whose vices are neither repented of,
nor receive punishment, at the conclusion of the drama. Dinarchus
may be regarded as a representation of the most profligate
of the Greek or Roman youth, yet he is not held up to
any particular censure; and, in the end, he is neither reformed
nor adequately punished. The portion, indeed, of the lady
whom he had violated, and at last agrees to espouse, is threatened
by her father to be diminished, but this seems merely
said in a momentary fit of resentment.

This play, with all its imperfections, is said to have been a

at Rome. It has descended to us rather in a mutilated
state, which may, perhaps, have deprived us of some fine sen<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page160">[pg 160]</span><a name="Pg160" id="Pg160" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>tences or witticisms, which the ancients had admired; for, as
a French translator of Plautus has remarked, their approbation
could scarcely have been founded on the interest of the subject,
the disposition of the incidents, or the moral which is
inculcated.

The character of Lolpoop, the servant of Belfond Senior,

The above-mentioned plays are the twenty dramas of Plautus,

Plautus; and of these, nearly forty titles, with a few scattered
fragments, still remain. From the time of Varro to that
of Aulus Gellius, it seems to have been a subject of considerable
discussion what plays were genuine; and it appears, that
the best informed critics had come to the conclusion, that a
great proportion of those comedies, which vulgarly passed for
the productions of Plautus, were spurious. Such a vast number
were probably ascribed to him, from his being the head
and founder of a great dramatic school; so that those pieces,
which he had perhaps merely retouched, came to be wholly
attributed to his pen. As in the schools of painting, so in
the dramatic art, a celebrated master may have disciples who
adopt his principles. He may give the plan which they fill
up, or complete what they have imperfectly executed. Many
paintings passed under the name of Raphael, of which Julio
Romano, and others, were the chief artists. <span class="tei tei-q">“There is no
doubt,”</span> says Aulus Gellius, <span class="tei tei-q">“but that those plays, which seem
not to have been written by Plautus, but are ascribed to him,
were by certain ancient poets, and afterwards retouched and
    polished by him<a id="noteref_270" name="noteref_270" href="#note_270"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">270</span></span></a>.”</span> Even those comedies which were written
in the same taste with his, came to be termed <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Fabulæ Plautinæ</span></span>,
in the same way as we still speak of Æsopian fable, and
Homeric verse. <span class="tei tei-q">“Plautus quidem,”</span> says Macrobius, <span class="tei tei-q">“ea re
clarus fuit, ut post mortem ejus, comœdiæ, quæ incertæ ferebantur,
    Plautinæ tamen esse, de jocorum copia, agnoscerentur<a id="noteref_271" name="noteref_271" href="#note_271"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">271</span></span></a>.”</span>
It is thus evident, that a sufficient number of jests
stamped a dramatic piece as the production of Plautus in the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page161">[pg 161]</span><a name="Pg161" id="Pg161" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>opinion of the multitude. But Gellius farther mentions, that
there was a certain writer of comedies, whose name was
Plautius, and whose plays having the inscription <span class="tei tei-q">“Plauti,”</span>
were considered as by Plautus, and were named Plautinæ
from Plautus, though in fact they ought to have been called
Plautianæ from Plautius. All this sufficiently accounts for
the vast number of plays ascribed to Plautus, and which the
most learned and intelligent critics have greatly restricted.
They have differed, however, very widely, as to the number
which they have admitted to be genuine. Some, says Servius,
maintain, that Plautus wrote twenty-one comedies, others
    forty, others a hundred<a id="noteref_272" name="noteref_272" href="#note_272"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">272</span></span></a>. Gellius informs us, that Lucius
Ælius, a most learned man, was of opinion that not more than
    twenty-five were of his composition<a id="noteref_273" name="noteref_273" href="#note_273"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">273</span></span></a>. Varro wrote a work,
entitled <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Quæstiones Plautinæ</span></span>, a considerable portion of which
was devoted to a discussion concerning the authenticity of the
plays commonly assigned to Plautus, and the result of his investigation
was, that twenty-one were unquestionably to be
admitted as genuine. These were subsequently termed Varronian,
in consequence of having been separated by Varro
from the remainder, as no way doubtful, and universally
allowed to be by Plautus. The twenty-one Varronian plays
are the twenty still extant, and the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vidularia</span></span>. This comedy
appears to have been originally subjoined to the Palatine
MS. of the still existing plays of Plautus, but to have been
torn off, since, at the conclusion of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Truculentus</span></span>, we
    find the words <span class="tei tei-q">“Vidularia incipit<a id="noteref_274" name="noteref_274" href="#note_274"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">274</span></span></a>:”</span> And Mai has recently
published some fragments of it, which he found in an Ambrosian
MS. Such, it would appear, had been the high authority
of Varro, that only those plays, which had received his
indubitable sanction, were transcribed in the MSS. as the
genuine works of Plautus; yet it would seem that Varro himself
had, on some occasion, assented to the authenticity of
several others, induced by their style of humour corresponding
to that of Plautus. He had somewhere mentioned, that
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Saturio</span></span> (the Glutton,) and the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Addictus</span></span>, (the Adjudged,)
were written by Plautus during the period in which he laboured
as a slave at the hand-mill. He was also of opinion, that
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bœotia</span></span> was by Plautus; and Aulus Gellius concurs with
    him in this<a id="noteref_275" name="noteref_275" href="#note_275"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">275</span></span></a>, citing certain verses delivered by a hungry parasite,
which, he says, are perfectly Plautinian, and must satisfy
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page162">[pg 162]</span><a name="Pg162" id="Pg162" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>every person to whom Plautus is familiar, of the authenticity
of that drama. From this very passage, Osannus derives an
argument unfavourable to the authenticity of the play. The
parasite exclaims against the person who first distinguished
hours, and set up the sun-dials, of which the town was so
full. Now, Osannus maintains, that there were no sun-dials
at Rome in the time of Plautus, and that the day was not then
    distributed into hours, but into much larger portions of time<a id="noteref_276" name="noteref_276" href="#note_276"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">276</span></span></a>.
The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Nervolaria</span></span> was one of the disputed plays in the time of
Au. Gellius; and also the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Fretum</span></span>, which Gellius thinks the
    most genuine of all<a id="noteref_277" name="noteref_277" href="#note_277"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">277</span></span></a>. Varro, in the first Book of his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Quæstiones 
Plautinæ</span></span> gives the following words of Attius, which,
I presume, are quoted from his work on poetry and poets,
entitled <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Didascalica</span></span>. <span class="tei tei-q">“For neither were the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Gemini</span></span>, the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Leones</span></span>, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Condalium</span></span>, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Anus Plauti</span></span>, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bis Compressa</span></span>, 
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bœotia</span></span>, or the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Commorientes</span></span>, by Plautus, but by M.
Aquilius.”</span> It appears, however, from the prologue to the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Adelphi</span></span> of Terence, that the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Commorientes</span></span> was written by
Plautus, having been taken by him from a Greek comedy of
    Diphilus<a id="noteref_278" name="noteref_278" href="#note_278"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">278</span></span></a>. In opposition to the above passage of Attius, and
to his own opinion expressed in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Quæstiones Plautinæ</span></span>, 
Varro, in his treatise on the Latin Language, frequently cites,
as the works of Plautus, the plays enumerated by Attius, and
various others; but this was probably in deference to common
opinion, or in agreement with ordinary language, and
was not intended to contradict what he had elsewhere delivered,
or to stamp with the character of authenticity productions,
    which he had more deliberately pronounced to be spurious<a id="noteref_279" name="noteref_279" href="#note_279"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">279</span></span></a>.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From the review which has now been given of the comedies
of Plautus, something may have been gathered of their general
scope and tenor. In each plot there is sufficient action, movement,
and spirit. The incidents never flag, but rapidly
accelerate the catastrophe. Yet, if we regard his plays in
the mass, there is a considerable, and perhaps too great,
uniformity in their fables. They hinge, for the most part, on
the love of some dissolute youth for a courtezan, his employment
of a slave to defraud a father of a sum sufficient to
supply his expensive pleasures, and the final discovery that
his mistress is a free-born citizen. The charge against
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page163">[pg 163]</span><a name="Pg163" id="Pg163" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Plautus of uniformity in his characters, as well as in his fables,
has been echoed without much consideration. The portraits
of Plautus, it must be remembered, were drawn or copied at
a time when the division of labour and progress of refinement
had not yet given existence to those various descriptions of
professions and artists—the doctor, author, attorney—in short,
all those characters, whose habits, singularities, and whims,
have supplied the modern Thalia with such diversified materials,
and whose contrasts give to each other such relief, that
no caricature is required in any individual representation.
The characters of Alcmena, Euclio, and Periplectomenes, are
sufficiently novel, and are not repeated in any of the other
dramas; but there is ample range and variety even in those
which he has most frequently employed—the avaricious old
man—the debauched young fellow—the knavish slave—the
braggart captain—the rapacious courtezan—the obsequious
parasite—and the shameless pander. On most of these parts
some observations have been made, while mentioning the
different comedies in which they are introduced. The severe
father and thoughtless youth, are those in which he has best
succeeded, or at least they are those with which we are best
pleased. The captain always appears to us exaggerated, and
the change which has taken place in society and manners
prevents us, perhaps, from entering fully into the characters
of the slave, the parasite, and pander; but in the fathers and
sons, he has shown his knowledge of our common nature, and
delineated them with the truest and liveliest touches. In the
former, the struggles of avarice and severity, with paternal
affection, are finely wrought up and blended. Even when
otherwise respectable characters, they are always represented
as disliking their wives, which was not inconsistent with the
manners of a Grecian state, in which marriage was merely
regarded as a duty; and was a feature naturally enough exhibited
on the theatre of a nation, one of whose most illustrious
characters declared in the Senate, as a received maxim,
that Romans married, not for the sake of domestic happiness,
but to rear up soldiers for the republic.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Latin style of Plautus excels in briskness of dialogue,
as well as purity of expression, and has been highly extolled
by the learned Roman grammarians, particularly by Varro,
who declares, that if the Muses were to speak Latin they
    would employ his diction<a id="noteref_280" name="noteref_280" href="#note_280"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">280</span></span></a>; but as M. Schlegel has remarked,
it is necessary to distinguish between the opinion of philologers,
and that of critics and poets. Plautus wrote at a period when
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page164">[pg 164]</span><a name="Pg164" id="Pg164" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>his country as yet possessed no written or literary language.
Every phrase was drawn from the living source of conversation.
This early simplicity seemed pleasing and artless to those Romans,
who lived in an age of excessive refinement and cultivation; 
but this apparent merit was rather accidental than the
effect of poetic art. Making, however, some allowance for
this, there can be no doubt that Plautus wonderfully improved
and refined the Latin language from the rude form in which it
had been moulded by Ennius. That he should have effected
such an alteration is not a little remarkable. Plautus was
nearly contemporary with the Father of Roman song—according
to most accounts he was born a slave—he was condemned,
during part of his life, to the drudgery of the lowest manual
labour—and, so far as we learn, he was not distinguished by
the patronage of the Great, or admitted into Patrician society.
Ennius, on the other hand, if he did not pass his life in affluence,
spent it in the exercise of an honourable profession, and
was the chosen familiar friend of Cato, Scipio Africanus, Fulvius
Nobilior, and Lælius, the most learned as well as polished
citizens of the Roman republic, whose conversation in their
unrestrained intercourse must have bestowed on him advantages
which Plautus never enjoyed. But perhaps the circumstance
of his Greek original, which contributed so much to his
learning and refinement, and qualified him for such exalted
society, may have been unfavourable to that native purity of
Latin diction, which the Umbrian slave imbibed from the unmixed
fountains of conversation and nature.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The chief excellence of Plautus is generally reputed to
consist in the wit and comic force of his dialogue; and, accordingly,
the lines in Horace’s <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Art of Poetry</span></span>, in which he
derides the ancient Romans for having foolishly admired the
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Plautinos sales</span></span>,”</span> has been the subject of much reprehension
    among critics<a id="noteref_281" name="noteref_281" href="#note_281"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">281</span></span></a>. That the wit of Plautus often degenerates
into buffoonery, scurrility, and quibbles,—sometimes
even into obscenity,—and that, in his constant attempts at
merriment, he too often tries to excite laughter by exaggerated
expressions, as well as by extravagant actions, cannot, in<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page165">[pg 165]</span><a name="Pg165" id="Pg165" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>deed, be denied. This, I think, was partly owing to the immensity
of the Roman theatres, and to the masks and trumpets
of the actors, which must have rendered caricature and grotesque
inventions essential to the production of that due effect,
which, with such scenic apparatus, could not be created, unless
by overstepping the modesty of nature. It must be always be
recollected, that the plays of Plautus were written solely to be
represented, and not to be read. Even in modern times, and
subsequently to the invention of printing, the greatest dramatists—Shakspeare,
for example—cared little about the publication
of their plays; and in every age or country, in which
dramatic poetry has flourished, it has been intended for public
representation, and has been adapted to the taste of a promiscuous
audience. It is the most social of all sorts of composition; 
and he who aims at popularity or success in it, must
leave the solitudes of inspiration for the bustle of the world.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The contemplative poet may find his delight, and his reward,
in the mere effort of imagination, but the poet of the
drama must seek them in the applause of the multitude. He
must stoop to men—be the mover of human hearts—and triumph
by the living and hourly passions of our nature. Now,
in the days of Plautus, the smiles of the polite critic were not
enough for a Latin comedian, because in those days there
were few polite critics at Rome; he required the shouts and
laughter of the multitude, who could be fully gratified only
by the broadest grins of comedy. Accordingly, many of the
jests of Plautus are such as might be expected from a writer
anxious to accommodate himself to the taste of the times, and
naturally catching the spirit of ribaldry which prevailed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
During the age of Plautus, and indeed long after it, the general
character of Roman wit consisted rather in a rude and
not very liberal satire, than a just and temperate ridicule, restrained
within the bounds of decency and good manners. A
favourite topic, for example, of ancient raillery, was corporal
defects;—a decisive proof of coarseness of humour, especially
as it was recommended by rule, and enforced by the authority
of the greatest masters, as one of the most legitimate sources
of ridicule.—<span class="tei tei-q">“Est deformitatis et corporis vitiorum satis bella
    materies ad jocandum,”</span> says Cicero, in his treatise <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De Oratore</span></span><a id="noteref_282" name="noteref_282" href="#note_282"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">282</span></span></a>.
The innumerable jests there recorded as having produced
the happiest effects at the bar, are the most miserable
puns and quibbles, coarse practical jokes, or personal reflections.
The cause of this defect in elegance of wit and raillery,
has been attributed by Hurd to the free and popular constitution
of Rome. This, by placing all its citizens, at least
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page166">[pg 166]</span><a name="Pg166" id="Pg166" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>during certain periods, on a level, and diffusing a general
spirit of independence, took off those restraints of civility
which are imposed by the dread of displeasing, and which
can alone curb the licentiousness of ridicule. The only court
to be paid was from the orators to the people, in the continual
and immediate applications to them which were rendered
necessary by the form of government. On such occasions, the
popular assemblies had to be entertained with those gross banters,
which were likely to prove most acceptable to them.
Design growing into habit, the orators, and after them the nation,
accustomed themselves to coarse ridicule at all times, till
the humour passed from the rostrum, or forum, to the theatre,
where the amusement and laughter of the people being the
direct and immediate aim, it was heightened to still farther
extravagance. This taste, says Hurd, was also fostered and
promoted at Rome by the festal license which prevailed in the
    seasons of the Bacchanalia and Saturnalia<a id="noteref_283" name="noteref_283" href="#note_283"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">283</span></span></a>. Quintilian
thinks, that, with some regulation, those days of periodical license
might have aided the cultivation of a correct spirit of
raillery; but, as it was, they tended to vitiate and corrupt it.
The Roman muse, too, had been nurtured amid satiric and
rustic exhibitions, the remembrance of which was still cherished,
and a recollection of them kept alive, by the popular
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Exodia</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Fabulæ Atellanæ</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Such being the taste of the audience whom he had to please,
and who crowded to the theatre not to acquire purity of taste,
but to relax their minds with merriment and jest, it became
the great object of Plautus to make his audience laugh; and
for this he sacrificed every other consideration. <span class="tei tei-q">“Nec quicquam,”</span>
says Scaliger, <span class="tei tei-q">“veritus est, modo auditorem excitaret
risu.”</span> With this view, he must have felt that he was more
likely to succeed by emulating the broader mirth of the old
or middle comedy, than by the delicate railleries and exquisite
painting of Menander. Accordingly, though he generally
borrowed his plots from the writers of the new comedy,
his wit and humour have more the relish of the old, and they
have been classed by Cicero as of the same description with
    the drollery which enlivened its scenes<a id="noteref_284" name="noteref_284" href="#note_284"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">284</span></span></a>. The audience, for
whom the plays of Plautus were written, could understand or
enjoy only a representation of the manners and witticisms to
which they were accustomed. To the fastidious critics of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page167">[pg 167]</span><a name="Pg167" id="Pg167" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>court of Augustus, an admirer of Plautus might have replied
in the words of Antiphanes, a Greek dramatist of the middle
comedy, who being commanded to read one of his plays to
Alexander the Great, and finding that the production was not
relished by the royal critic, thus addressed him: <span class="tei tei-q">“I cannot
wonder that you disapprove of my comedy, for he who could
be entertained by it must have been present at the scenes it
represents. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">He must be acquainted with the public humours
of our vulgar ordinaries</span></span>—have been familiar with the impure
manners of our courtezans—a party in the breaking up of
many a brothel—and a sufferer, as well as actor, in those unseemly
riots. Of all these things you are not informed; and
the fault lies more in my presumption in intruding them on
your hearing, than in any want of fidelity with which I have
    portrayed them<a id="noteref_285" name="noteref_285" href="#note_285"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">285</span></span></a>.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Indeed, this practice of consulting the tastes of the people,
if it be a fault, is one which is common to all comic writers.
Aristophanes, who was gifted with far higher powers than
Plautus, and who was no less an elegant poet than a keen satirist,
as is evinced by the lyric parts of his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Frogs</span></span>, often prostituted
his talents to the lowest gratifications of the multitude.
Shakspeare regarded the drama as entirely a thing for the
people, and treated it as such throughout. He took the popular
comedy as he found it; and whatever enlargements or
improvements he introduced on the stage, were still calculated
and contrived according to the spirit of his predecessors, and
the taste of a London audience. When, in Charles’s days, a
ribald taste became universal in England, <span class="tei tei-q">“unhappy Dryden”</span>
bowed down his genius to the times. Even in the refined age
of Louis XIV., it was said of the first comic genius of his
country, that he would have attained the perfection of his art,

His indulgent conformity, however, to the unpolished taste
of his age, ought not to be admitted as an excuse for the obscenities
which Plautus has introduced. But though it must
be confessed, that he is liable to some censure in this particular,
he is not nearly so culpable as has been generally imagined.
The commentators, indeed, have been often remarkably
industrious in finding out allusions, which do not consist very
clearly with the plain and obvious meaning of the context.
The editor of the Delphin Plautus has not rejected above five
pages from the twenty plays on this account; and many passages
even in those could hardly offend the most scrupulous

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Trinummus</span></span>, are free from any moral objection; and, with the

It being the great aim of Plautus to excite the merriment of
the rabble, he, of course, was little anxious about the strict
preservation of the dramatic unities; and it was a more important
object with him to bring a striking scene into view, than
to preserve the unity of place. In the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Aulularia</span></span>, part of the
action is laid in the miser’s dwelling, and part in the various
places where he goes to conceal his treasure: in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Mostellaria</span></span>
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Truculentus</span></span>, the scene changes from the street to

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But, notwithstanding these and other irregularities, Plautus
so enchanted the people by the drollery of his wit, and the
buffoonery of his scenes, that he continued the reigning favourite
of the stage long after the more correct plays of Cæcilius, 
Afranius, and even Terence, were first represented.

having been at first called by the servile appellation of

He was a native of Milan, and flourished towards
the end of the sixth century of Rome, having survived Ennius,
whose intimate friend he was, about one year, which places
his death in 586. We learn from the prologue to the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hecyra</span></span> 
of Terence, spoken in the person of Ambivius, the principal
actor, or rather manager of the theatre, that, when he first
brought out the plays of Cæcilius, some were hissed off the
stage, and others hardly stood their ground; but knowing the
fluctuating fortunes of dramatic exhibitions, he had again
attempted to bring them forward. His perseverance having
obtained for them a full and unprejudiced hearing, they failed
not to please; and this success excited the author to new
efforts in the poetic art, which he had nearly abandoned in a
fit of despondency. The comedies of Cæcilius, which amounted
to thirty, are all lost, so that our opinion of their merits can
be formed only from the criticisms of those Latin authors who
wrote before they had perished. Cicero blames the improprieties
    of his style and language<a id="noteref_287" name="noteref_287" href="#note_287"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">287</span></span></a>. From Horace’s Epistle
to Augustus, we may collect what was the popular sentiment
concerning Cæcilius—
</p>

<div class="tei tei-lg" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em; margin-left: 2.00em; margin-top: 1.00em">

<div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left"><span class="tei tei-q" style="text-align: left">“Vincere Cæcilius gravitate—Terentius arte.”</span></div>

</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is not easy to see how a comic author could be more grave
than Terence; and the quality applied to a writer of this cast
appears of rather difficult interpretation. But the opinion
which had been long before given by Varro affords a sort of
commentary on Horace’s expression—<span class="tei tei-q">“In argumentis,”</span> says
he, <span class="tei tei-q">“Cæcilius palmam poscit; in ethesi Terentius.”</span> By <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">gravitas</span></span>,
therefore, as applied to Cæcilius, we may properly
enough understand the grave and affecting plots of his comedies;
which is farther confirmed by what Varro elsewhere
observes of him—<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pathe</span></span> Trabea, Attilius, et Cæcilius facile
moverunt.”</span> Velleius Paterculus joins him with Terence and
Afranius, whom he reckons the most excellent comic writers
of Rome—<span class="tei tei-q">“Dulcesque Latini leporis facetiæ per Cæcilium,
    Terentiumque, et Afranium, sub pari ætate, 
    nituerunt<a id="noteref_288" name="noteref_288" href="#note_288"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">288</span></span></a><a name="corr169" id="corr169" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">.</span>”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A great many of the plays of Cæcilius were taken from
Menander; and Aulus Gellius informs us that they seemed
agreeable and pleasing enough, till, being compared with
their Greek models, they appeared quite tame and disgusting,
and the wit of the original, which they were unable to imitate,<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page170">[pg 170]</span><a name="Pg170" id="Pg170" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
    totally vanished<a id="noteref_289" name="noteref_289" href="#note_289"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">289</span></span></a>. He accordingly contrasts a scene in the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Plocius</span></span> (or Necklace,) of Cæcilius, with the corresponding
scene in Menander, and pronounces them to be as different
in brightness and value as the arms of Diomed and Glaucus.
The scenes compared are those where an old husband complains
that his wife, who was rich and ugly, had obliged him
to sell a handsome female slave, of whom she was jealous.
This chapter of Aulus Gellius is very curious, as it gives us a
more perfect notion than we obtain from any other writer, of
the mode in which the Latin comic poets copied the Greeks.
To judge from this single comparison, it appears that though
the Roman dramatists imitated the incidents, and caught the
ideas of their great masters, their productions were not entirely
translations or slavish versions: A different turn is
frequently given to a thought—the sentiments are often differently
expressed, and sometimes much is curtailed, or
altogether omitted.

In particular, we learn from the prologue to the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phormio</span></span>,
that he was fond of bringing on the stage frantic youths, committing
all those excesses of folly and distraction which are
supposed to be produced by violent love. Donatus has
afforded us an account of the plot of his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phasma</span></span>, which was
taken from Menander. A lady, who, before marriage, had a
daughter, the fruit of a secret amour with a person now living
in a house adjacent to her husband’s, made an opening in the
wall of her own dwelling, in order to communicate with that
in which her former paramour and daughter resided. That
this entrance might appear a consecrated spot to her husband’s
family, she decked it with garlands, and shaded it with
branches of trees. To this passage she daily repaired as if to
pay her devotions, but in fact, to procure interviews with her
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page172">[pg 172]</span><a name="Pg172" id="Pg172" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>illegitimate daughter. Her husband also had, by a former
wife, a son, who dwelt in his father’s house, and who, having
one day accidentally peeped through the aperture, beheld the
girl; and, as she was possessed of almost supernatural beauty,
he was struck with awe, as at the sight of a Spirit or divinity,
whence the play received the name of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phasma</span></span>. The young
man, discovering at length that she is a mortal, conceives for
her a violent passion, and is finally united to her, with the consent
of his father, and to the great satisfaction of the mother.
There is another play of Menander, which has also been
closely imitated by Luscius Lavinius. Plautus, we have seen,
borrowed his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Trinummus</span></span> from the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Thesaurus</span></span> of Philemon.
But Menander also wrote a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Thesaurus</span></span>, which has been copied
by Lavinius. An old man, by his last will, had commanded,
that, ten years after his death, his son should carry libations
to the monument under which he was to be interred. The
youth, having squandered his fortune, sold the ground on
which this monument stood to an old miser. At the end of
ten years, the prodigal sent a servant to the tomb with due
offerings, according to the injunctions of his deceased father.
The servant applied to the new proprietor to assist him in
opening the monument, in which they discovered a hoard of
gold. The miserly owner of the soil seized the treasure, and
retained it on pretence of having deposited it there for safety
during a period of public commotion. It is claimed, however,
by the young man, who goes to law with him; and the plot of
the comedy chiefly consists in the progress of the suit<a id="noteref_295" name="noteref_295" href="#note_295"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">295</span></span></a>—the
dramatic management of which has been ridiculed by Terence,
in the prologue to the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Eunuchus</span></span>, since, contrary to the custom
and rules of all courts of justice, the author had introduced
the defendant pleading his title to the treasure before
the plaintiff had explained his pretensions, and entered on the
grounds of his demand. Part of the old Scotch ballad, The
Heir of Linne, has a curious resemblance to the plot of this
play of Luscius Lavinius.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Turpilius, Trabea, and Attilius, were the names of comic
writers who lived towards the end of the sixth and beginning
of the seventh century, from the building of Rome. Of these,
and other contemporary dramatists, it would now be difficult
to say more than that their works have perished, and to repeat
a few scattered incidental criticisms delivered by Varro or
Cicero. To them probably may be attributed the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Baccharia</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cæcus</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cornicularia</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Parasitus</span></span>, and innumerable other comedies,
of which the names have been preserved by gramma<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page173">[pg 173]</span><a name="Pg173" id="Pg173" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>rians. Of such works, once the favourites of the Roman stage,
few memorials survive, and these only to be found separate
and imperfect in the quotations of scholiasts. Sometimes
from a single play numerous passages have been preserved;
but they are so detached, that they neither give us any insight
into the fable to which they appertain, nor enable us to pronounce
on the excellence of the dramatic characters. In
general, they comprise so small a portion of uninterrupted
dialogue, that we can scarcely form a judgment even of the
style and manner of the poet, or of the beauty of his versification.
All that is now valuable in these fragments is a few brief
moral maxims, and some examples of that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vis comica</span></span>, which
consists in an ingenious and forcible turn of expression in the
original language.

It is not difficult to account for the vast number of dramatic
productions which we thus see were brought forward at Rome
in the early ages of the Republic. There are two ways in
which literature may be supported,—By the patronage of
distinguished individuals, as it was in the time of Mæcenas
and the age of Lorenzo de Medici; or, By the encouragement
of a great literary public, as it is now rewarded in modern
Europe. But, in Rome, literature as yet had not obtained the
protection of an emperor or a favourite minister; and previous
to the invention of printing, which alone could give extensive
circulation to his productions, a poet could hardly gain a
livelihood by any means, except by supplying popular entertainments
for the stage. These were always liberally paid for
by the Ædiles, or other directors of the public amusements.
To this species of composition, accordingly, the poet directed
his almost undivided attention; and a prodigious facility was
afforded to his exertions by the inexhaustible dramatic stores
which he found prepared for him in Greece.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
which are perhaps the most valuable remains that have descended
to us among the works of antiquity. This celebrated
dramatist, the delight and ornament of the Roman stage, was
born at Carthage, about the 560th year of Rome. In what
manner he came or was brought thither is uncertain. He
was, in early youth, the freedman of one Terentius Lucanus
in that city, whose name has been perpetuated only by the
glory of his slave. After he had obtained his freedom, he
became the friend of Lælius, and of the younger Scipio Africanus<a id="noteref_299" name="noteref_299" href="#note_299"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">299</span></span></a>.
His <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Andria</span></span> was not acted till the year 587—two
years, according to the Eusebian Chronicle, after the death of
Cæcilius; which unfortunately throws some doubt on the
agreeable anecdote recorded by Donatus, of his introduction,
in a wretched garb, into the house of Cæcilius, in order to
read his comedy to that poet, by whom, as a mean person, he
was seated on a low stool, till he astonished him with the
matchless grace and elegance of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Andria</span></span>, when he was
placed on the couch, and invited to partake the supper of the
veteran dramatist. Several writers have conjectured, it might
be to another than to Cæcilius that Terence read his comedy<a id="noteref_300" name="noteref_300" href="#note_300"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">300</span></span></a>;
or, as the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Andria</span></span> is not indisputably his first comedy, that it
might be one of the others which he read to Cæcilius<a id="noteref_301" name="noteref_301" href="#note_301"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">301</span></span></a>. Supposing
the Eusebian Chronicle to be accurate in the date
which it fixes for the death of Cæcilius, it is just possible,
that Terence may have written and read to him his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Andria</span></span> two
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page176">[pg 176]</span><a name="Pg176" id="Pg176" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>years previous to its representation. After he had given six
comedies to the stage, Terence left Rome for Greece, whence
he never returned. The manner of his death, however, is
altogether uncertain. According to one report, he perished
at sea, while on his voyage from Greece to Italy, bringing
with him an hundred and eight comedies, which he had translated
from Menander: according to other accounts, he died in
Arcadia for grief at the loss of those comedies, which he had
sent before him by sea to Rome. In whatever way it was
occasioned, his death happened when he was at the early age
of thirty-four, and in the year 594 from the building of the
city.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Andria</span></span>,—acted in 587, is the first in point of time, and is
usually accounted the first in merit, of the productions of
Terence. Like most of his other comedies, it has a double
plot. It is compounded of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Andrian</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Perinthian</span></span> of
Menander; but it does not appear, that Terence took his
principal plot from one of those Greek plays, and the under-plot
from the other. He employed both to form his chief
fable; and added the characters, on which the under plot is
founded, from his own invention, or from some third play now
unknown to us.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At the commencement of the play, Simo, the father of
Pamphilus, informs Sosia of his son’s love for Glycerium. In
consequence of a report of this attachment spreading abroad,
Chremes refuses his daughter, who had previously been promised
to Pamphilus in marriage: Simo, however, still pretends
to make preparations for the nuptials, in order more
accurately to ascertain the state of his son’s affections. Charinus,
the lover of Chremes’ daughter, is in despair at the
prospect of this union; but he is comforted by the assurances
of Pamphilus, that he would do every thing in his power to
retard it. By this time, Davus, the slave of Pamphilus, discovers,
that it is not intended his master’s marriage should in
reality proceed; and, perceiving it is a pretext, he advises
Pamphilus to declare that he is ready to obey his father’s
commands. Glycerium, meanwhile, gives birth to a child;
but Simo believes, that her reported delivery was a stratagem
of Davus, to deter Chremes from acceding to his daughter’s
marriage with Pamphilus. Simo, however, at length prevails
on him to give his consent. Pamphilus is thus placed in a
most perplexing dilemma with all parties. His mistress, Glycerium,
and her attendants, believe him to be false; while
Charinus thinks that he had deceived him; and, as he had
given his consent to the marriage, he can form no excuse to
his father or Chremes for not concluding it. Hence his rage
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page177">[pg 177]</span><a name="Pg177" id="Pg177" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>against Davus, and new stratagems on the part of the slave
to prevent the nuptials. He contrives that Chremes should
overhear a conversation between him and Mysis, Glycerium’s
attendant, concerning the child which her mistress bore to
Pamphilus, and Chremes in consequence instantly breaks off
from his engagement. In this situation, Crito arrives to claim
heirship to Chrysis, the reputed sister of Glycerium. He
discloses, that Glycerium having been shipwrecked in infancy,
had been preserved by his kinsman, the father of Chrysis;
and, from his detail, it is discovered, that she is the daughter
of Chremes. There is thus no farther obstacle to her marriage
with Pamphilus; and the other daughter of Chremes is
of course united to Charinus.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The long narrative with which the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Andria</span></span>, like several
other plays of Terence, commences, and which is a component
part of the drama itself, is beautiful in point of style,
and does not fail to excite our interest concerning the characters.
We perceive the compassion and even admiration
of Simo for Glycerium, and we feel that, if convinced of her
respectable birth and character, he would have preferred her
to all others, even to the daughter of Chremes. Glycerium,
indeed, does not appear on the stage; but her actual appearance
could scarcely have added to the interest which her
hapless situation inspires. Simo is the model of an excellent
father. He is not so easily duped by his slaves as most of
the old men in Plautus; and his temper does not degenerate,
like that of many other characters in the plays of Terence,
either into excessive harshness, or criminal indulgence. His
observations are strikingly just, and are the natural language
of age and experience. Chremes, the other old man, does
not divide our interest with Simo; yet we see just enough of
his good disposition, to make us sympathize with his happiness
in the discovery of a daughter. Pamphilus is rendered interesting
by his tenderness for Glycerium, and respect for his
father. Davus supports the character of a shrewd, cunning,
penetrating slave; he is wholly devoted to the interests of
Pamphilus, but is often comically deterred from executing
his stratagems by dread of the lash of his old master. The
part of Crito, too, is happily imagined: His apprehension
lest he be suspected of seeking an inheritance to which he
has no just title, and his awkward feelings on coming to claim
the wealth of a kinswoman of suspicious character, are artfully
unfolded. Even the gossip and absurd flattery of the
midwife, Lesbia, is excellent. The poet has also shewn considerable
address in portraying the character of Chrysis, who
was supposed to be the sister of Glycerium, but had died
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page178">[pg 178]</span><a name="Pg178" id="Pg178" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>previous to the commencement of the action. In the first
scene, he represents her as having for a long while virtuously
struggled with adverse fortune, and having finally been precipitated
into vice rather by pressure of poverty than depravity
of will; and afterwards, in the pathetic account which
Pamphilus gives of his last conference with her, we insensibly
receive a pleasing impression of her character, and forget her
errors for the sake of her amiable qualities. All this was
necessary, in order to prevent our forming a disadvantageous
idea of Glycerium, who had resided with Chrysis, but was
afterwards to become the wife of Pamphilus, and to be acknowledged
as the daughter of Chremes.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This play has been imitated in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Andrienne</span></span> of Baron,
the celebrated French actor. The Latin names are preserved
in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">dramatis personæ</span></span>, and the first, second, and fifth acts,
have been nearly translated from Terence. In the fourth,
however, instead of the marriage being interrupted by Davus’s
stratagem, Glycerium, hearing a report of the falsehood of
her lover, rushes on the stage, throws herself at the feet of
Chremes, and prevails on him to break off the intended
match between his daughter and Pamphilus. But, though
the incidents are nearly the same, the dialogue is ill written,
and is very remote from the graceful ease and simplicity of
Terence.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Steele’s <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Conscious Lovers</span></span> is the best imitation of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Andria</span></span>.
The English play, it will be remembered, commences
in a similar manner with the Latin comedy, by Sir John
Bevil relating to an old servant, that he had discovered the
love of his son for Indiana, an unknown and stranger girl,
by his behaviour at a masquerade. The report of this attachment
nearly breaks off an intended marriage between young
Bevil and Lucinda, Sealand’s daughter. Young Bevil relieves
the mind of Myrtle, the lover of Lucinda, by assuring
him that he is utterly averse to the match. Still, however,
he pretends to his father, that he is ready to comply with his
wishes; and, meanwhile, writes to Lucinda, requesting that
she would refuse the offer of his hand. Myrtle, hearing of
this correspondence having taken place, without knowing its
import, is so fired with jealousy that he sends Bevil a challenge.
Sealand, being still pressed by Sir John to bestow
his daughter in marriage, waits on Indiana, in order to discover
the precise nature of her relations with Bevil. She details
to him her story; and, on his alluding to the probability of
the projected nuptials being soon concluded, she tears off, in
a transport of passion, a bracelet, by which Sealand discovers,
that she is a daughter whom he had lost, and who, while
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page179">[pg 179]</span><a name="Pg179" id="Pg179" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>proceeding to join him in the East Indies, had been carried
into a French harbour, where she first met with young Bevil.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
An English translator of Terence remarks, <span class="tei tei-q">“That Steele has
unfolded his plot with more art than his predecessor, but is
greatly his inferior in delineation of character. Simo is the
most finished character in the Latin piece, but Sir John Bevil,
who corresponds to him, is quite insignificant. Young Bevil
is the most laboured character in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Conscious Lovers</span></span>, but he
is inferior to Pamphilus. His deceit is better managed by Terence
than Steele. Bevil’s supposed consent to marry is followed
by no consequence; and his honest dissimulation, as he
calls it, is less reconcilable to the philosophic turn of his
character, than to the natural sensibility of Pamphilus. Besides,
the conduct of the latter is palliated, by being driven
to it by the artful instigations of Davus, who executes the
lower part of the stratagems, whereas Bevil is left entirely to
his own resources.”</span> Bevil, indeed, in spite of his refinement
and formality, his admiration of the moral writers, and, <span class="tei tei-q">“the
charming vision of Mirza consulted in a morning,”</span> is a good
deal of a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Plato-Scapin</span></span>. Indiana, who corresponds to Glycerium,
is introduced with more effect than the ladies in the
French plays imitated from Terence. Her tearing off her
ornaments, however, in a fit of despair, at the conclusion, is
too violent. It is inconsistent with the rest of her character;
and we feel that she would not have done so, had not the author
found that the bracelet was necessary for her recognition
as the daughter of Sealand. The under plot is perhaps better
managed in the English than in the Latin play. Myrtle
sustains a part more essential to the principal fable than Charinus;
and his character is better discriminated from that of
Bevil than those of the two lovers in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Andria</span></span>. The part
of Cimberton, the other lover of Lucinda, favoured by Mrs
Sealand, is of Steele’s own contrivance; and of course, also,
the stratagem devised by Bevil, in which Myrtle and Tom
pretend to be lawyers, and Myrtle afterwards personates Sir
Geoffry Cimberton, the uncle of his rival.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Andria</span></span> has also suggested those scenes of Moore’s
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Foundling</span></span>, which relate to the love of young Belmont, and
the recognition of Fidelia as the daughter of Sir Charles Raymond.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Eunuchus</span></span>.—Though, in modern times, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Andria</span></span> has
been the most admired play of Terence, in Rome the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Eunuchus</span></span>
was by much the most popular of all his performances,
and he received for it 8000 sesterces, the greatest reward
which poet had ever yet obtained<a id="noteref_302" name="noteref_302" href="#note_302"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">302</span></span></a>. In the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Andria</span></span>, indeed,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page180">[pg 180]</span><a name="Pg180" id="Pg180" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>there is much grace and delicacy, and some tenderness; but
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Eunuchus</span></span> is so full of vivacity and fire, as almost to redeem
its author from the well-known censure of Cæsar, that
there was no <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vis comica</span></span> in his dramas.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The chief part of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Eunuchus</span></span> is taken from a play of the
same title by Menander; but the characters of the parasite
and captain have been transferred into it from another play of
Menander, called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kolax</span></span>. There was an old play, too, by
Nævius, founded on the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kolax</span></span>; but Terence, in his prologue,
denies having been indebted to this performance.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The scenes of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Eunuchus</span></span> are so arranged, that the
main plot is introduced by that which is secondary, and which
at first has the appearance of being the principal one. Phædria
is brought on the stage venting his indignation at being
excluded from the house of the courtezan Thais, for the sake
of Thraso, who is the sole braggart captain exhibited in the
plays of our author. Thais, however, succeeds in persuading
Phædria that she would admit Thraso only for two days, in
order to obtain from him the gift of a damsel who had originally
belonged to the mother of Thais, but after her death
had been sold to the captain. Phædria, vying in gifts with
Thraso, presents his mistress with an Ethiopian eunuch. The
younger brother of Phædria, who is called Chærea, having
accidentally seen the maid presented to Thais by Thraso, falls
in love with her, and, by a stratagem of his father’s slave Parmeno,
he is introduced as the <a name="corr180" id="corr180" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">eunuch</span> to the house of Thais,
where he does not in all respects consistently support the character
he had assumed. After Chærea had gone off, his adventure
was discovered; and Pythias, the waiting maid of Thais, in
revenge for Parmeno’s fraud, tells him that Chærea, having
been detected, was about to be made precisely what he had
pretended to be. Parmeno, believing this report, informs
the father of Chærea, who instantly rushes into the house of
Thais, (to which, by this time, his son had ventured to return,)
and being there relieved from his sudden apprehension, he
consents the more readily to the marriage of Chærea with the
girl whom he had deluded, and who is now discovered to be
an Athenian citizen, and the sister of Chremes. In this paroxysm
of good humour, he also agrees that Phædria should
retain Thais as his mistress. Thraso and his parasite, Gnatho,
having been foiled in an attack on the house of Thais, enter
into terms, and, at the persuasion of Gnatho, Thraso is admitted
into the society of Phædria, and is allowed to share with him
the favours of Thais.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There are thus, strictly speaking, three plots in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Eunu</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page181">[pg 181]</span><a name="Pg181" id="Pg181" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-style: italic">chus</span></span>, but they are blended with inimitable art. The quarrel
and reconciliation of Thais and Phædria promote the marriage
of Chærea with Pamphila, the girl presented by Thraso
to Thais. This gift again produces the dispute between
Phædria and Thais, and gives room for the imposture of
Chærea. It is unfortunate that the regard in which the ancient
dramatists held the unity of place, interposed between the
spectators and the representation of what would have been
highly comical—the father discovering his son in the eunuch’s
habit in the house of Thais, the account of which has been
thrown into narrative. At the conclusion Thraso is permitted,
with consent of Phædria, to share the good graces of Thais;
but, as has been remarked by La Harpe<a id="noteref_303" name="noteref_303" href="#note_303"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">303</span></span></a> and Colman<a id="noteref_304" name="noteref_304" href="#note_304"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">304</span></span></a>, and
as indeed must be felt by every one who reads the play, this
termination is scarcely consistent with the manners of gentlemen,
and it implies the utmost meanness in Phædria to
admit him into his society, or to allow him a share in the
favours of his mistress, merely that he may defray part of the
expense of her establishment.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The drama, however, is full of vivacity and intrigue.
Through the whole piece the author amuses us with his
pleasantries, and in no scene discovers that his fund of entertainment
is exhausted. Most of the characters, too, are happily
sketched. Under Thais, Menander is supposed to have given
a representation of his own mistress Glycerium. On the general
nature of the parts of the parasite and braggart captain,
something has been said while treating of the dramas of
Plautus; but Terence has greatly refined and improved on
these favourite characters of his predecessor. Gnatho is master
of a much more delicate and artful mode of adulation than
former flatterers, and supports his consequence with his patron,
at the same time that he laughs at him and lives on him. He
boasts, in the second scene of the second act, that he is the
founder of a new class of parasites, who ingratiated themselves
with men of fortune and shallow understandings, solely
by humouring their fancies and admiring what they said, instead
of earning a livelihood by submitting to blows, the
ridicule of the company, and all manner of indignities, like the
antiquated race of parasites whom Plautus describes as beaten,
kicked, and abused at pleasure:—

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The new parasite, of whom Gnatho may be considered as the
representative, had been delineated in the characters of
Theophrastus, and has more resemblance to Shakspeare’s
Osrick, or to the class of parasites described by Juvenal as
infesting the families of the Great in the latter ages of Rome<a id="noteref_305" name="noteref_305" href="#note_305"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">305</span></span></a>.
Thraso, the braggart captain, in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Eunuchus</span></span>, is ridiculous
enough to supply the audience with mirth, without indulging
in the extravagant bluster of Pyrgopolinices. A scene in the
fourth act gives the most lively representation of the conceit
and ridiculous vanity of this soldier, who, calling together a
few slaves, pretends to marshal and draw them up as if they
formed a numerous army, and assumes all the airs of a general.
This part is so contrived, that nothing could have more happily
tended to make him appear ridiculous though he says
nothing extravagant, or beyond what might naturally be expected
from the mouth of a coxcomb. One new feature in
Thraso’s character is his fondness for repeating his jests, and
passion for being admired as a wit no less than a warrior.
There is, perhaps, nowhere to be found a truer picture of the
fond and froward passion of love, than that which is given us
in the character of Phædria. Horace and Persius, when they
purposely set themselves to expose and exaggerate its follies,
could imagine nothing beyond it. The former, indeed, in
the third satire of his second book, where he has given a picture
of the irresolution of lovers, has copied part of the
dialogue introduced near the commencement of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Eunuchus</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The love, however, both of Phædria and Chærea is more
that of temperament than sentiment: Of consequence, the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Eunuchus</span></span> is inferior to the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Andria</span></span> in delicacy and tenderness;
but there are not wanting passages which excel in these higher
qualities. Addison has remarked<a id="noteref_306" name="noteref_306" href="#note_306"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">306</span></span></a>, that Phædria’s request to

a comedy by Aretine, in which the courtezan who gives

Orfinio to Phædria,—the characteristic dispositions of both
the originals being closely followed in the copy. A youth,
from his disguise supposed to be a girl, is presented to La
Talanta by Tinca, the Thraso of the piece, who, being exasperated
at the treatment he had received from the courtezan,
meditates, like Thraso, a military attack on her dwelling-house;
and, though easily repulsed, he is permitted at the
conclusion, in respect of his wealth and bounty, to continue
to share with Orfinio the favours of La Talanta.

in any of his other performances; and hence, perhaps, it has

excellent original.”</span> Fontaine, instead of adapting the incidents
to Parisian manners, like Moliere and Regnard, in
their delightful imitations of Plautus, has retained the ancient
names, and scene of action. The earlier part is a mere translation
from the Latin, except that the character of Thais is
softened down from a courtezan to a coquette. The next
deviation from the original is the omission of the recital by
Chærea, of the success of his audacious enterprize—instead of
which, Fontaine has introduced his Chærea professing honourable
and respectful love to Pamphile. In the unravelling of
the dramatic plot, the French author has departed widely
from Terence. There is nothing of the alarm concerning
Chærea given by Thais’ maid to Parmeno, and by him communicated
to the father: The old man merely solicits Parmeno
to prevail on his sons to marry:—

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This wish is doubly accomplished, by the discovery that Pamphile
is of reputable birth, and by Phædria’s reconciliation
with Thais. While making such changes on the conclusion,
and accommodating it in some measure to the feelings of the
age, I am surprised that the French author retained that part
of the compact with Thraso, by which he is to remain in the
society of Phædria merely to be fleeced and ridiculed.

The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Eunuchus</span></span> is also the origin of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Le Muet</span></span> by Bruyes and
Palaprat, who laboured in conjunction, like our Beaumont and
Fletcher, and who have made such alterations on the Latin
drama as they thought advisable in their age and country. In
this play, which was first acted in 1691, a young man, who
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page184">[pg 184]</span><a name="Pg184" id="Pg184" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>feigns to be dumb, is introduced as a page in a house where
his mistress resided. But although an Ethiopian eunuch,
which was an article of state among the ancients, may have
attracted the fancy of Thais, it is not probable that the French
countess should have been so desirous to receive a present of
a dumb page. Those scenes in which the credulous father is
made to believe that his son had lost the power of speech,
from the effects of love and sorcery, and is persuaded, by a
valet disguised as a doctor, that the only remedy for his
dumbness is an immediate union with the object of his passion,
are improbable and overcharged. The character of the
parasite is omitted, and instead of Thraso we have a rough
blunt sea captain, who had protected Zayde when lost by her
parents.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The only English imitation of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Eunuchus</span></span> is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bellamira,
or the Mistress</span></span>, an unsuccessful comedy by Sir Charles Sedley,
first printed in 1687. In this play the scene lies in London,
but there is otherwise hardly any variation in the incidents;
and there is no novelty introduced, except Bellamira and
Merryman’s plot of robbing Dangerfield, the braggart captain
of the piece, an incident evidently borrowed from Shakspeare’s
Henry IV.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Heautontimorumenos</span></span>. The chief plot of this play, which I
think on the whole the least happy effort of Terence’s imitation,
and which, of all his plays, is the most foreign from our
manners, is taken, like the last-mentioned drama, from Menander.
It derives its Greek appellation from the voluntary punishment
inflicted on himself by a father, who, having driven
his son into banishment by excess of severity, avenges him,
by retiring to the country, where he partakes only of the hardest
fare, and labours the ground with his own hands. The
deep parental distress, however, of Menedemus, with which
the play opens, forms but an inconsiderable part of it, as the
son, Clinia, returns in the second act, and other incidents of
a comic cast are then interwoven with the drama. The plan
of Clitopho’s mistress being brought to the house both of
Menedemus and his neighbour Chremes, in the character of
Clinia’s mistress, has given rise to some amusing situations:
but the devices adopted by the slave Syrus, to deceive and
cheat the two old men, are too intricate, and much less ingenious
than those of a similar description in most other Latin
plays. One of his artifices, however, in order to melt the
heart of Chremes, by persuading him that Clitopho thinks he is
not his son, has been much applauded; particularly the preparation
for this stratagem, where, wisely concluding that one
would best contribute to the imposition who was himself de<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page185">[pg 185]</span><a name="Pg185" id="Pg185" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>ceived, he, in the first place, makes Clitopho believe that he
is not the son of his reputed father.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Terence himself, in his prologue, has called this play <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">double</span></span>, 
probably in allusion to the two plots which it contains. Julius
Scaliger absurdly supposes that it was so termed because one
half of the play was represented in the evening, and the other
half on the following morning<a id="noteref_307" name="noteref_307" href="#note_307"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">307</span></span></a>. It has been more plausibly
conjectured, that the original plot of the Greek play was simple,
consisting merely of the character of the Self-tormentor
Menedemus, the love of his son Clinia for Antiphila, and the
discovery of the real condition of his mistress; but that Terence
had added to this single fable, either from his own
invention, or from some other Greek play, the passion of Clitopho
for Bacchis, and the devices of the slave in order to
extract money from old Chremes<a id="noteref_308" name="noteref_308" href="#note_308"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">308</span></span></a>. These two fables are
connected by the poet with much art, and form a double
intrigue, instead of the simple argument of the Greek original.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Diderot has objected strongly to the principal subject which
gives name to this play, and to the character of the self-tormenting
father. Tragedy, he says, represents individual characters,
like those of Regulus, Orestes, and Cato; but the
chief characters in comedy should represent a class or species,
and if they only resemble individuals, the comic drama
would revert to what it was in its infancy.—<span class="tei tei-q">“Mais on peut
dire,”</span> continues he, <span class="tei tei-q">“que ce pere là n’est pas dans la nature.
Une grande ville fourniroit a peine dans un siecle l’example
d’une affliction aussi bizarre.”</span> It is observed in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Spectator</span></span><a id="noteref_309" name="noteref_309" href="#note_309"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">309</span></span></a>,
on the other hand, that though there is not in the whole
drama one passage that could raise a laugh, it is from beginning
to end the most perfect picture of human life that ever
was exhibited.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There has been a great contest, particularly among the
French critics, whether the unities of time and place be preserved
in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Heautontimorumenos</span></span>. In the year 1640, Menage
had a conversational dispute, on this subject, with the Abbé
D’Aubignac, with whom he at that period lived on terms of
the most intimate friendship. The latter, who contended for
the strictest interpretation of the unities, first put his arguments
in writing, but without his name, in his <span class="tei tei-q">“Discours sur
la troisieme comedie de Terence; contre ceux qui pensent
qu’elle n’est pas dans les regles anciennes du poeme dramatique.”</span>
Menage answered him in his <span class="tei tei-q">“Reponse au <a name="corr185" id="corr185" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">discours,</span>”</span>
&amp;c.; and, in 1650, he published both in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Miscellanea</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page186">[pg 186]</span><a name="Pg186" id="Pg186" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>without leave of the author of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Discours</span></span>. This, and some
disrespectful expressions employed in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Reponse</span></span>, gave mortal
offence to the Abbé, who, in 1655, wrote a reply to the
answer, entitled <span class="tei tei-q">“Terence Justifié, &amp;c. contre les Erreurs de
Maistre Gilles Menage, Avocat en Parlement.”</span> This designation
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Maistre</span></span>, proved intolerable to the feelings of Menage.
Hearing that the tract was full of injurious expressions,
he declared publicly and solemnly, that he never would read
it; but being afterwards urged to peruse it by some good-natured
friends, he consulted the casuists of the Sorbonne,
and the College of Jesuits, on the point of conscience; and
having at last read it with their approval, he wrote a full
reply, which was not published till after the death of his
opponent.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In these various tracts, it was maintained by the Abbé,
that unity of time was most strictly preserved in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Heautontimorumenos</span></span>,
as a less period than twelve hours was supposed
to pass during the representation, the longest space to which,
by the rules of the drama, it could be legitimately prolonged.
Of course he adduces arguments and citations, tending to
restrict, as far as possible, the period of the dramatic action.
In the third scene of the second act, it is said <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vesperascit</span></span>, 
and in the first scene of the third act, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Luciscit hoc jam</span></span>. 
Now the Abbé, giving to the term <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vesperascit</span></span> the signification,
<span class="tei tei-q">“It is already night,”</span> was of opinion, that the action
commenced as late as seven or eight in the evening, when
Menedemus returned to Athens from his farm; that the scene
of the drama is supposed to pass during the Pithœgia, or festivals
of Bacchus, held in April, at which season not more
than nine hours intervened between twilight and dawn; that
the festival continued the whole night, and that none of the
characters went to bed, so that the continuity of action was
no more broken than the unity of time. Menage, on the
other hand, contended that at least fifteen hours must be
granted to the dramatic action, but that this extension implied
no violation of the dramatic unities, which, according to the
precepts of Aristotle, would not have been broken, even if
twenty-four hours had been allotted. He successfully shews,
however, that fifteen hours, at least, must be allowed. According
to him, the play opens early in the evening, while
Menedemus is yet labouring in his field. The festivals were
in February; and he proves, from a minute examination, that
the incidents which follow after it is declared that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">luciscit</span></span>, 
must have occupied fully three hours. Some of the characters,
he thinks, retired to rest, but no void was thereby left
in the action, as the two lovers, Bacchis, and the slaves, sat
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page187">[pg 187]</span><a name="Pg187" id="Pg187" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>up arranging their amorous stratagems. Madame Dacier
adopted the opinion of Aubignac, which she fortified by reference
to a wood engraving in a very ancient MS. in the
Royal Library, which represents Menedemus as having quitted
his work in the fields, and as bearing away his implements
of husbandry.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The poet being perhaps aware that the action of this comedy
was exceptionable, and that the dramatic unities were
not preserved in the most rigid sense of the term, has apparently
exerted himself to compensate for these deficiencies by
the introduction of many beautiful moral maxims: and by
that purity of style, which distinguishes all his productions,
but which shines, perhaps, most brightly in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Heautontimorumenos</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That part of the plot of this comedy, where Clitopho’s mistress
is introduced as Clinia’s mistress, into the house of both
the old men, has given rise to Chapman’s comedy, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">All Fooles</span></span>, 
which was first printed in 1605, 4to., and was a favourite
production in its day. In this play, by the contrivance of
Rynaldo, the younger son of Marc Antonio, a lady called
Gratiana, privately married to his elder brother Fortunio, is
introduced, and allowed to remain for some time at the house
of their father, by persuading him that she is the wife of
Valerio, the son of one of his neighbours, who had married
her against his parent’s inclination, and that it would be an
act of kindness to give her shelter, till a reconciliation could
be effected. By this means Fortunio enjoys the society of his
bride, and Valerio, her pretended husband, has, at the same
time, an admirable opportunity of continuing his courtship of
Bellonora, the daughter of Marc Antonio.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Adelphi</span></span>.—The principal subject of this drama is usually
supposed to have been taken from Menander’s <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Adelphoi</span></span>; but
it appears that Alexis, the uncle of Menander, also wrote a
comedy, entitled <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Adelphoi</span></span>; so that perhaps the elegant Latin
copy may have been as much indebted to the uncle’s as to the
nephew’s performance, for the delicacy of its characters and
the charms of its dialogue. We are informed, however, in
the prologue, that the part of the drama in which the music
girl is carried off from the pander, has been taken from the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Synapothnescontes</span></span> of Diphilus. That comedy, though the
version is now lost, had been translated by Plautus, under the
title of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Commorientes</span></span>. He had left out the incidents, however,
concerning the music girl, and Terence availed himself
of this omission to interweave them with the principal plot of
his delightful drama—<span class="tei tei-q">“Minus existimans laudis proprias scribere
quam Græcas transferre.”</span></p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page188">[pg 188]</span><a name="Pg188" id="Pg188" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The title, which is supposed to be imperfect, is derived
from two brothers, on whose contrasted characters the chief
subject and amusement of the piece depend. Demea, the
elder, who lived in the country, had past his days in thrift and
labour, and was remarkable for his severe penurious disposition.
Micio, the younger brother, was, on the contrary, distinguished
by his indulgent and generous temper. Being a
bachelor, he had adopted Æschinus, his brother’s eldest son,
whom he brought up without laying much restraint on his
conduct. Ctesipho, the other son of Demea, was educated
with great strictness by his father, who boasted of the regular
and moral behaviour of this child, which, as he thought, was
so strongly contrasted with the excesses of him who had been
reared under the charge of his brother. Æschinus at length
carries off a music girl from the slave-merchant, in whose
possession she was. Hence fresh indignation on the part of
Demea, and new self-congratulation on the system of education
he had pursued with Ctesipho: Hence, too, the deepest
distress on the part of an unfortunate girl, to whom Æschinus
had promised marriage; and also of her relations, at this proof
of his alienated affections. At last, however, it is discovered
that Æschinus had run off with the music girl, for the sake,
and at the instigation, of his brother Ctesipho. The play accordingly
concludes with the union of Æschinus and the girl
to whom he was betrothed, and the total change of disposition
on the part of Demea, who now becomes so complete a
convert to the system of Micio, that he allows his son to retain
the music girl as his mistress.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The plot of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Adelphi</span></span> may thus be perhaps considered as
double; but the interest which Æschinus takes in Ctesipho’s
amour, combines their loves so naturally, that they can hardly
be considered as distinct or separate; and the details by which
the plot is carried on, are managed with such infinite skill,
that the intrigue of at least four acts of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Adelphi</span></span> is more
artfully conducted than that of any other piece of Terence.
At the commencement of the play, Micio summons his servant
Storax, whom he had sent to find out Æschinus; but as
the servant does not appear, Micio concludes that the youth
had not yet returned from the place where he had supped on
the preceding evening, and is in consequence overwhelmed
with all the tender anxiety of a father concerning an absent
son. This alarm gives us some insight into the character of
the young man, and explains the interest Micio takes in his
welfare, without shewing too plainly the art and design of the
author. His uneasiness, by naturally leading him to reflect on
the situation of the family, and the doubtful part he had him<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page189">[pg 189]</span><a name="Pg189" id="Pg189" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>self acted, brings in less awkwardly than usual one of those
long soliloquies, in which the domestic affairs of the speaker
are explained by him for the sake of the audience. Demea is
then introduced, having just learned, on his arrival in the city,
that Æschinus had carried off the music girl. His character
and predominant feelings are finely marked in the account
which he gives of this outrage, dwelling on every minute particular,
and exaggerating the offences of Æschinus. This
passage, too, acquires additional zest and relish, on a second
perusal of the play, when it is known that the son so much commended
is chiefly in fault. The grief of the mother of the
girl, who was betrothed to Æschinus, and the honest indignation
of her faithful old servant Geta, are highly interesting.
The interview of Micio with his adopted son, after he had discovered
the circumstances of this connection, is eminently
beautiful. His delicate reproof for the young man’s want of
confidence, in not communicating to him the state of his heart—the 
touches of good humour, mildness, and affection, which
may be traced in every line of Micio’s part of the dialogue, as
well as the natural bursts of passion, and ingenuous shame, in
Æschinus, are perhaps more characteristic of the tender and
elegant genius of Terence, than any other scene in his dramas.
But the triumph of comic art, is the gradation of Demea’s anger
and distresses—his perfect conviction of the sobriety of
his son, who, he is persuaded by Syrus, had shewn the utmost
indignation at the conduct of Æschinus, and had gone to the
country in disgust, when in fact he was at that moment seated
at a feast—then his perplexity on not finding him at the farm,
and his learning that Æschinus, having violated a free citizen,
was about to be married to her, though she had no portion.
Even his meeting Syrus intoxicated augments his rage, at the
general libertinism and extravagance of the family. At length
the climax of events is finally completed, by discovering that
the music girl had been carried off for the sake of his favourite
son, and by finding him at a carousal with his brother’s dissolute
family.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
With this incident the fable naturally concludes, and it is
perhaps to be regretted that Terence had not also ended the
drama with the third scene of the fifth act, where Demea
breaks in upon the entertainment. The conversion of Demea,
indeed, with which the remaining scenes are occupied,
grows out of the preceding events. He had met, during the
course of the play, with many mortifications—his anger, complaints,
and advice, had been all neglected and slighted—he
had seen his brother loved and followed, and found himself
shunned; but such a change in long-confirmed habits could
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page190">[pg 190]</span><a name="Pg190" id="Pg190" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>hardly have been effected in so short a period, or by a single
lesson, however striking and important. His complaisance,
too, is awkward, and his generosity is evidently about to run
into profusion.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But if all this be an impropriety, what shall we say of the
gross absurdity of Micio, a bachelor of sixty-five, marrying an
old woman, the mother of Æschinus’ bride, (and whom he had
never seen but once,) merely out of complaisance to his friends,
who seemed to have no motive in making the request, except
that she was quite solitary, had nobody to care for her, and
was long past child-bearing—
</p>

<div class="tei tei-lg" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em; margin-left: 2.00em; margin-top: 1.00em">

<div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left">—— <span class="tei tei-q" style="text-align: left">“Parere jam diu hæc per annos non potest:</span></div>
<div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left"><span class="tei tei-q" style="text-align: left">Nec, qui eam respiciat, quisquam est; sola est.”</span></div>

</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Micio had all along been represented as possessed of so much
judgment, good sense, and knowledge of the world, that this
last piece of extravagance destroys the interest we had previously
felt in the character. Donatus, who has given us some
curious information in his excellent commentary on Terence,
with regard to the manner in which he had altered his comedies
from the original Greek, says, that in the play of Menander,
the old Bachelor has no reluctance at entering into a state
of matrimony.—<span class="tei tei-q">“Apud Menandrum, Senex de nuptiis non
gravatur.”</span> The English translator of Terence thinks, that
the Latin poet, by making Micio at first express a repugnance
to the proposed match, has improved on his model; but it appears
to me, that this only makes his unbounded complaisance
more improbable and ridiculous. Indeed the incongruity and
inconsistence of the concluding scenes of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Adelphi</span></span>, have
been considered so great, that a late German translator of
Terence has supposed that they did not form a component part
of the regular comedy, but were in fact the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Exodium</span></span>, a sort
of afterpiece, in which the characters of the preceding play
were usually represented in grotesque situations, and with
overcharged colours<a id="noteref_310" name="noteref_310" href="#note_310"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">310</span></span></a>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
So much for the plot of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Adelphi</span></span>, and the incidents by
which the conclusion is brought about. With regard to the
characters of the piece, Æschinus is an excellent delineation
of the elegant ease and indifference of a fine gentleman. In
one scene, however, he is represented as a lover, full of tenderness,
and keenly alive to all the anxieties, fears, and emotions
of the passion by which he is affected. In the parts of Demea
and Micio, the author has violated the precept of Horace with
regard to a dramatic character:
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page191">[pg 191]</span><a name="Pg191" id="Pg191" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<div class="tei tei-lg" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em; margin-left: 2.00em; margin-top: 1.00em">

<div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left"><span class="tei tei-q" style="text-align: left">Qualis ab incepto processerit, et sibi constet.”</span></div>

</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
During four acts, however, the churlishness of Demea is well
contrasted with the mildness of Micio, whose fondness and partiality
for his adopted son are extremely pleasing. <span class="tei tei-q">“One
great theatrical resource,”</span> says Gibbon, <span class="tei tei-q">“is the opposition
and contrast of characters which thus display each other. The
severity of Demea, and easiness of Micio, throw mutual light;
and we could not be so well acquainted with the misanthropy
of Alceste, were it not for the fashionable complaisant character
of Philinte<a id="noteref_311" name="noteref_311" href="#note_311"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">311</span></span></a>.”</span> Accordingly, in the modern drama, we
often find, that if one of the lovers be a gay companion, the
other is grave and serious; like Frankly and Bellamy, in the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Suspicious Husband</span></span>, or Absolute and Faulkland in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rivals</span></span>. 
Yet in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Adelphi</span></span>, the contrast, perhaps, is too direct, and too
constantly obtruded on the attention of the audience. It has
the appearance of what is called antithesis in writing, and, in
the conduct of the drama, has the same effect as that figure in
composition. Diderot, in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Essay on Dramatic Poetry</span></span>, also
objects to these two contrasted characters, that, being drawn
with equal force, the moral intention of the drama is rendered
equivocal; and that we have something of the same feeling
which every one has experienced while reading the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Misanthrope</span></span>

It is not unlikely, however, that this sort of uncertainty
was just the intention of Terence, or rather of Menander. It
was probably their design to show the disadvantages resulting
from each mode of education pursued, and hence, by an easy
inference, to point out the golden mean which ought to be
preserved by fathers; for, if Demea be unreasonably severe,
the indulgence of Micio is excessive, and his connivance at
the disorders of Ctesipho, which he even assisted him to support,
is as reprehensible, as the extraordinary sentiment which
he utters at the commencement of the comedy:—

A play possessing so many excellencies as the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Adelphi</span></span>, 
could scarcely fail to be frequently imitated by modern dramatists.
It has generally been said, that Moliere borrowed
from the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Adelphi</span></span> his comedy <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">L’Ecole des Maris</span></span>, where the
brothers Sganarelle and Ariste, persons of very opposite dispositions,
bring up two young ladies intrusted to their care on
different systems; the one allowing a proper liberty—the other,
who wished to marry his ward, employing a constant restraint,
which, however, did not prevent her from contriving to elope
with a favoured lover. The chief resemblance consists in the
characters of the two guardians—in some of the discussions,
which they hold together on their opposite systems of management—and
some observations in soliloquy on each other’s
folly. Thus, for example, Demea, the severe brother in Terence,
exclaims:

Indeed, were it not for the minute resemblance of particular
passages, I would think it as likely, that Moliere had been
indebted for the leading idea of his comedy to the second
tale of the eighth night of Straparola, an Italian novelist of
the sixteenth century, from whom he unquestionably borrowed
the plot of his admirable comedy, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">L’Ecole des Femmes</span></span>. The
principal amusement, however, in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ecole des Maris</span></span>, which
consists of Isabelle complaining to her guardian, Sganarelle,
of her lover, Valere, has been suggested by the third novel,
in the third day of Boccaccio’s <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Decameron</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A much closer imitation of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Adelphi</span></span> than the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ecole des
Maris</span></span> of Moliere may be found in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ecole des Peres</span></span>, by
Baron, author of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Andrienne</span></span>. The genius of this celebrated
actor seems to have been constrained by copying from
Terence, which has deprived his drama of all air of originality,
while, at the same time, his alterations are such as to render
it but an imperfect image of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Adelphi</span></span>. It were, therefore,
to be wished, that he had adhered more closely to the Roman
poet, or, like Moliere, deviated from him still farther. His
exhibition of Clarice and Pamphile, the mistresses of the two
young men, on the stage, has no better effect than the introduction
of Glycerium in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Andrienne</span></span>. The characters of
Telamon and Alcée are so altered, as to preserve neither the
strength nor delicacy of those of Micio and Demea; while the
change of disposition, which the severe father undergoes in
the fifth act, has been neither rejected nor retained: He accedes
to the proposals for his children’s happiness, but his
complaisance is evidently forced and sarcastic; and he ultimately,
in a fit of bad humour, breaks off all connection with
his family:

Diderot had evidently his eye on the characters of Micio
and Demea in drawing those of M. d’Orbesson and Le Commandeur,
in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Comedie Larmoyante</span></span>, entitled <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Le Pere de
Famille</span></span>. The scenes between the Pere de Famille and his

beautiful dialogue, already mentioned, which passes between
Micio and his adopted child.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Adelphi</span></span> is also the origin of Shadwell’s comedy, the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Squire of Alsatia</span></span>. Spence, in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Anecdotes</span></span><a id="noteref_314" name="noteref_314" href="#note_314"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">314</span></span></a>, says, on the
authority of Dennis the critic, that the story on which the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Squire of Alsatia</span></span> was built, was a true fact. That the whole
plot is founded on fact, I think very improbable, as it coincides
most closely with that of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Adelphi</span></span>. Sir William and Sir
Edward Belfond are the two brothers, while Belfond senior
and junior correspond to Æschinus and Ctesipho. The chief
alteration, and that to which Dennis probably alluded, is
the importance of the part assigned to Belfond senior; who,
having come to London, is beset and cozened by all sorts of
bankrupts and cheats, inhabitants of Alsatia, (Whitefriars,)
and by their stratagems is nearly inveigled into a marriage
with Mrs Termagant, a woman of infamous character, and
furious temper. The part of Belfond junior is much less
agreeable than that of Æschinus. His treatment of Lucia
evinces, in the conclusion, a hard-hearted infidelity, which we
are little disposed to pardon, especially as we feel no interest
in his new mistress, Isabella. On the whole, though the plots
be nearly the same, the tone of feeling and sentiment are very
different, and the English comedy is as remote from the Latin
original, as the grossest vulgarity can be from the most simple
and courtly elegance. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Squire of Alsatia</span></span>, however, took
exceedingly at first as an occasional play. It discovered the
cant terms, that were before not generally known, except to
cheats themselves; and was a good deal instrumental towards
causing the great nest of villains in the metropolis to be regulated
by public authority<a id="noteref_315" name="noteref_315" href="#note_315"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">315</span></span></a>.

In Cumberland’s <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Choleric Man</span></span>, the chief characters, though
he seems to deny it in his dedicatory epistle to Detraction,
have also been traced after those of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Adelphi</span></span>. The love
intrigues, indeed, are different; but the parts of the half-brothers,
Manlove and Nightshade, (the choleric-man,) are
evidently formed on those of Micio and Demea; while the
contrasted education, yet similar conduct, of the two sons of
Nightshade, one of whom had been adopted by Manlove, and
the father’s rage on detecting his favourite son in an amorous
intrigue, have been obviously suggested by the behaviour of
Æschinus and Ctesipho.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hecyra</span></span>—Several of Terence’s plays can hardly be accounted
comedies, if by that term be understood, dramas which
excite laughter. They are in what the French call the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">genre
serieux</span></span>, and are perhaps the origin of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">comedie larmoyante</span></span>.
The events of human life, for the most part, are neither deeply
distressing nor ridiculous; and, in a dramatic representation
of such incidents, the action must advance by embarrassments
and perplexities, which, though below tragic pathos, are not
calculated to excite merriment. Diderot, who seems to have
been a great student of the works of Terence, thinks the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hecyra</span></span>,
or Mother-in-law, should be classed among the serious
dramas. It exhibits no buffoonery, or tricks of slaves, or ridiculous
parasite, or extravagant braggart captain; but contains
a beautiful and delightful picture of private life, and those
distresses which ruffle <span class="tei tei-q">“the smooth current of domestic joy.”</span>
It was taken from a play of Apollodorus; but, as Donatus informs
us, was abridged from the Greek comedy,—many things
having been represented in the original, which, in the imitation,
are only related. In the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hecyra</span></span>, a young man, called
Pamphilus, had long refused to marry, on account of his
attachment to the courtezan Bacchis. He is at length, however,
constrained by his father to choose a wife, whose gentleness
and modest behaviour soon wean his affections from his
mistress. Pamphilus being obliged to leave home for some
time, his wife, on pretence of a quarrel with her mother-in-law,
quits his father’s house; and Pamphilus, on his return
home, finds, that she had given birth to a child, of which he
supposed that he could not have been the father. His wife’s
mother begs him to conceal her disgrace, which he promises;
and affecting extraordinary filial piety, assigns as his reason
for not bringing her home, the capricious behaviour of which
she had been guilty towards his mother. That lady, in con<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page196">[pg 196]</span><a name="Pg196" id="Pg196" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>sequence, offers to retire to the country. Pamphilus is thus
reduced to the utmost perplexity; and all plausible excuses for
not receiving his wife having failed, his father suspects that
he had renewed his intercourse with Bacchis. He, accordingly,
sends for that courtezan, who denies the present existence
of any correspondence with his son; and, being eager
to clear the character as well as to secure the happiness of
her former lover, she offers to confirm her testimony before
the family of the wife of Pamphilus. During the interview
which she in consequence obtains, that lady’s mother perceives
on her hand a ring which had once belonged to her
daughter, and which Bacchis now acknowledges to have
received from Pamphilus, as one which he had taken from a
girl whom he had violated, but had never seen. It is thus
discovered by Pamphilus, that the lady to whom he had offered
this injury before marriage was his own wife, and that he himself
was father of the child to whom she had just given birth.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The fable of this play is more simple than that of Terence’s
other performances, in all of which he had recourse to the
expedient of double plots. This, perhaps, was partly the
reason of its want of success on its first and second representations.
When first brought forward, in the year 589, it was
interrupted by the spectators leaving the theatre, attracted by
the superior interest of a boxing-match, and rope-dancers. A
combat of gladiators had the like unfortunate effect when it
was attempted to be again exhibited, in 594. The celebrated
actor, L. Ambivius, encouraged by the success which he had
experienced in reviving the condemned plays of Cæcilius,
ventured to produce it a third time on the stage<a id="noteref_317" name="noteref_317" href="#note_317"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">317</span></span></a>, when it
received a patient hearing, and was frequently repeated.
Still, however, most of the old critics and commentators speak
of it as greatly inferior to the other plays of Terence. Bishop
Hurd, on the contrary, in his notes on Horace, maintains, that
it is the only one of his comedies which is written in the true
ancient Grecian style; and that, for the genuine beauty of
dramatic design, as well as the nice coherence of the fable,
it must appear to every reader of true taste, the most masterly
and exquisite of the whole collection. Some scenes are doubtless
very finely wrought up,—as that between Pamphilus and
his mother, after he first suspects the disgrace of his wife, and
that in which it is revealed to him by his wife’s mother. The
passage in the second scene of the first act, containing the
picture of an amiable wife, who has succeeded in effacing
from the heart of her husband the love of a dissolute cour<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page197">[pg 197]</span><a name="Pg197" id="Pg197" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>tezan, has been highly admired. But, notwithstanding these
partial beauties, and the much-applauded simplicity of the
plot, there is, I think, great want of skilful management in
the conduct of the fable; and if the outline be beautiful, it
certainly is not so well filled up as might have been expected
from the taste of the author. In the commencement, he introduces
the superfluous part of Philotis, (who has no concern
in the plot, and never appears afterwards,) merely to
listen to the narrative of the circumstances and situation of
those who are principal persons in the drama. It is likewise
somewhat singular, that Pamphilus, when told by the mother
of the injury done to his wife, should not have remembered
his own adventure, and thus been led to suspect the real circumstances.
This communication, too, ought, as it probably
did in the Greek original, to have formed a scene between
Pamphilus and his wife’s mother; but, instead of this, Pamphilus
is introduced relating to himself the whole discourse
which had just passed between them. At length, the issue
of the fable is disclosed by another long soliloquy from the
courtezan. Indeed, all the plays of Terence abound in soliloquies
very inartificially introduced; and there is none of them
in which he has so much erred in this way as in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hecyra</span></span>.
The wife of Pamphilus, too, the character calculated to give
most interest, does not appear at all on the stage; and the
whole play is consumed in contests between the mother-in-law
and the two fathers. The characters of these old men,—the
fathers of Pamphilus and his wife,—so far from being contrasted,
as in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Adelphi</span></span>, have scarcely a shade of difference.
Both are covetous and passionate; very ready to vent their
bad humour on their wives and children, and very ready to
exculpate them when blamed by others. The uncommon and
delicate situation in which Pamphilus is placed, exhibits him
in an interesting and favourable point of view. He wishes
to conceal what had occurred, yet is scarcely able to dissemble.
Parmeno, the slave of Pamphilus, a lazy inquisitive character,
is humorously kept, through the whole course of the play, in
continual employment, and total ignorance. Sostrata’s mild
character, and the excellent behaviour of Bacchis, show, that
in this play, Terence had attempted an innovation, by introducing
a good mother-in-law, and an honest courtezan, whose
object was to acquire a reputation of not resembling those of
her profession. It appears from the Letters of Alciphron and
from Athenæus, that there actually was a Greek courtezan of
the name of Bacchis, distinguished from others of her class,
in the time of Menander, by disinterestedness, and comparative
modesty of demeanour. This circumstance, added to the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page198">[pg 198]</span><a name="Pg198" id="Pg198" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>fact of Menander having written a play, entitled <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Glycerium</span></span>, 
(which was the name of his mistress,) leads us to believe that
the Greek comedies sometimes represented, not merely the
general character of the courtezan, but individuals of that
profession; and that probably the Bacchis of Apollodorus, and
his imitator Terence, may have been the courtezan of this
name, who rejected the splendid offers of the Persian Satrap,
to remain the faithful mistress of the poor Meneclides<a id="noteref_318" name="noteref_318" href="#note_318"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">318</span></span></a>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phormio</span></span>—like the last mentioned play, was taken from the
Greek of Apollodorus, who called it <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Epidicazomenos</span></span>. Terence
named it <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phormio</span></span>, from a parasite whose contrivances
form the groundwork of the comedy, and who connects its
double plot. In this play two brothers had gone abroad,
each leaving a son at home, one of whom was called Antipho,
and the other Phædria, under care of their servant Geta.
Antipho having fallen in love with a woman apparently of
mean condition, in order that he might marry her, yet at the
same time possess a plausible excuse to his father for his conduct,
persuades Phormio to assume the character of her patron.
Phormio accordingly brings a suit against Antipho, as
her nearest of kin, and he, having made no defence, is ordained
in this capacity, according to an Athenian law, to marry the
supposed orphan. About the same time, Phædria, the other
youth, had become enamoured of a music girl; but he had
no money with which to redeem her from the slave merchant.
The old men, on their return home, are much disconcerted by
the news of Antipho’s marriage, as it had been arranged between
them that he should espouse his cousin. Phormio, at
the suggestion of Geta, avails himself of this distress, in order
to procure money for redeeming Phædria’s music girl. He
consents to take Antipho’s wife home to himself, provided he
gets a portion with her, which being procured, is immediately
laid out in the purchase of Phædria’s mistress. After these
plots are accomplished, it is discovered that Antipho’s wife is
the daughter of his uncle, by a woman at Lemnos, with whom
he had an amour before marriage, and that she had come to
Athens during his absence in search of her father. This is
found out at the end of the third act, but the play is injudiciously
protracted, after the principal interest is exhausted,
with the endeavours of the old men to recover the portion
which had been given to Phormio, and the dread of Chremes
lest the story of his intrigue at Lemnos should come to the
knowledge of his wife. The play accordingly languishes after
the discovery, notwithstanding all the author’s attempts to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page199">[pg 199]</span><a name="Pg199" id="Pg199" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>support the interest of the piece by the force of pleasantry
and humour.

The double plot of this play has been said to be united, by
both hingeing on the part of the parasite. But this is not a
sufficient union either in tragedy or comedy. I cannot, therefore,
agree with Colman, <span class="tei tei-q">“that the construction of the fable
is extremely artful,”</span> or that <span class="tei tei-q">“it contains a vivacity of intrigue
perhaps even superior to that of the Eunuch, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">particularly in
the catastrophe</span></span>. The diction,”</span> he continues, with more
truth, <span class="tei tei-q">“is pure and elegant, and the first act as chastely written
as that of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Self-Tormentor</span></span> itself. The character of
Phormio is finely separated from that of Gnatho, and is better
drawn than the part of any parasite in Plautus. Nausistrata
is a lively sketch of a shrewish wife, as well as Chremes
an excellent draught of a hen-pecked husband, and more in the
style of the modern drama than perhaps any character in ancient
comedy, except the miser of Plautus. There are also
some particular scenes and passages deserving of all commendation,
as the description of natural and simple beauty in the
person of Fannia, and that in which Geta and Phædria try to
inspire some courage into Antipho, overwhelmed by the
sudden arrival of his father<a id="noteref_319" name="noteref_319" href="#note_319"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">319</span></span></a>.”</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is curious that this play, which Donatus says is founded
on passions almost too high for comedy, should have given
rise to the most farcical of all Moliere’s productions, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Les Fourberies
de Scapin</span></span>. a celebrated, though at first, an unsuccessful
play, where, contrary to his usual practice, he has burlesqued
rather than added dignity to the incidents of the original
from which he borrowed. The plot, indeed, is but a frame to
introduce the various tricks of Scapin, who, after all, is a much
less agreeable cheat than Phormio: His deceptions are too
palpable, and the old men are incredible fools. As in Terence,
there are two fathers, Argante and Geronte, and during
the absence of the former, his son Octave falls in love with
and marries a girl, whom he had accidentally seen bewailing
the death of her mother. At the same time, Leandre, the son
of Geronte, becomes enamoured of an Egyptian, and Scapin,
the valet of Octave, is employed to excuse to the father the
conduct of his son, and to fleece him of as much money as
might be necessary to purchase her. The first of these objects
could not well be attained by Terence’s contrivance of the
law-suit; and it is therefore pretended that he had been forced
into the marriage by the lady’s brother, who was a bully,
(Spadassin,) and to whom the father agrees to give a large
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page200">[pg 200]</span><a name="Pg200" id="Pg200" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>sum of money, that he might consent to the marriage being
dissolved. It is then discovered that the girl whom Octave
had married is the daughter of Geronte, and the Egyptian is
found out, by the usual expedient of a bracelet, to be the long
lost child of Argante. Many of the most amusing scenes and
incidents are also copied from Terence, as Scapin instructing
Octave to regulate his countenance and behaviour on the approach
of his father—his enumeration to the father of all the
different articles for which the brother of his son’s wife will
require money, and the accumulating rage of Argante at each
new <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">item</span></span>. Some scenes, however, have been added, as that
where Leandre, thinking Scapin had betrayed him, and desiring
him to confess, obtains a catalogue of all the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Fourberies</span></span> 
he had committed since he entered his service, which is taken
from an Italian piece entitled <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pantalone, Padre di Famiglia</span></span>. 
He has also introduced from the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pedant Joué</span></span> of Cyrano Bergerac,
the device of Scapin for extorting money from Geronte,
which consists in pretending that his son, having accidentally
gone on board a Turkish galley, had been detained, and
would be inevitably carried captive to Algiers, unless instantly
ransomed. In this scene, which is the best of the play, the
struggle between habitual avarice and parental tenderness,
and the constant exclamation, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Que diable alloit il faire dans
cette galere du Turc</span></span>,”</span> are extremely amusing. Boileau has
reproached Moliere for having

in allusion to the scene where Scapin persuades Geronte that
the brother, accompanied by a set of bullies, is in search of
him, and stuffs him, for concealment, into a sack, which he
afterwards beats with a stick. This is compounded of two
scenes in the French farces, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Piphagne</span></span> and the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Francisquine</span></span>
of Tabarin, and, like the originals from which it is derived,
is quite farcical and extravagant:—

The chief improvement which Moliere has made on Terence
is the reservation of the discovery to the end; but the double
discovery is improbable. The introduction of Hyacinthe and
Zerbinette on the stage, is just as unsuccessful as the attempt
of Baron to present us, in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Andrienne</span></span>, with a lady corresponding
to Glycerium. Moliere’s Hyacinthe is quite insipid
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page201">[pg 201]</span><a name="Pg201" id="Pg201" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and uninteresting, while Zerbinette retains too much of the
Egyptian, and is too much delighted with the cheats of Scapin,
to become the wife of an honest man.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From the above sketches some idea may have been formed
of Terence’s plots, most of which were taken from the Greek
stage, on which he knew they had already pleased. He has
given proofs, however, of his taste and judgment, in the additions
and alterations made on those borrowed subjects; and
I doubt not, had he lived an age later, when all the arts were
in full glory at Rome, and the empire at its height of power
and splendour, he would have found domestic subjects sufficient
to supply his scene with interest and variety, and would no
longer have accounted it a greater merit—<span class="tei tei-q">“Græcas transferre
quam proprias scribere.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Terence was a more rigid observer than his Roman predecessors
of the unities of time and place. Whatever difference
of opinion may be entertained with regard to the preservation
of these unities in tragedy, since great results are often slowly
prepared, and in various quarters, there can be no doubt that
they are <a name="corr201" id="corr201" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">appropriate</span> in comedy, which, moving in a domestic
circle, and having no occasion to wander, like the tragic or
epic muse, through distant regions, should bring its intrigue
to a rapid conclusion. Terence, however, would have done
better not to have adhered so strictly to unity of place, and to
have allowed the scene to change at least from the street or
portico in front of a house, to the interior of the dwelling.
From his apparently regarding even this slight change as
inadmissible, the most sprightly and interesting parts of the
action are often either absurdly represented as passing on the
street, though of a nature which must have been transacted
within doors, or are altogether excluded. A striking example
of the latter occurs in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Eunuchus</span></span>, where the discovery of
Chærea by his father in the eunuch’s garb has been related,
instead of being represented. Plautus, who was of bolder
genius, varies the place of action, when the variation suits
his great purpose of merriment and jest.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But though Terence has perhaps too rigidly observed the
unities of time and place, in none of his dramas, with a single
exception, has that of plot been adhered to. The simplicity
and exact unity of fable in the Greek comedies would have
been insipid to a people not thoroughly instructed in the
genuine beauties of the drama. Such plays were of too thin
contexture to satisfy the somewhat gross and lumpish taste of
a Roman audience. The Latin poets, therefore, bethought
themselves of combining two stories into one, and this junction,
which we call the double plot, by affording the oppor<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page202">[pg 202]</span><a name="Pg202" id="Pg202" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>tunity of more incidents, and a greater variety of action, best
contributed to the gratification of those whom they had to
please. But of all the Latin comedians, Terence appears to
have practised this art the most assiduously. Plautus has
very frequently single plots, which he was enabled to support
by the force of drollery. Terence, whose genius lay another
way, or whose taste was abhorrent from all sort of buffoonery,
had recourse to the other expedient of double plots; and this,
I suppose, is what gained him the popular reputation of being
the most artful writer for the stage. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hecyra</span></span> is the only
one of his comedies of the true ancient cast, and we know
how unsuccessful it was in the representation<a id="noteref_321" name="noteref_321" href="#note_321"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">321</span></span></a>. In managing
a double plot, the great difficulty is, whether also to divide
the interest. One thing, however, is clear, that the part which
is episodical, and has least interest, should be unravelled first;
for if the principal interest be exhausted, the subsidiary intrigue
drags on heavily. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Andrian</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Self Tormentor</span></span>, and
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phormio</span></span>, are all faulty in this respect. On the whole, however,
the plots of Terence are, in most respects, judiciously
laid: The incidents are selected with taste, connected with
inimitable art, and painted with exquisite grace and beauty.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Next to the management of the plot, the characters and
manners represented are the most important points in a comedy; 
and in these Terence was considered by the ancients as
surpassing all their comic poets.—<span class="tei tei-q">“In argumentis,”</span> says
Varro, <span class="tei tei-q">“Cæcilius palmam poscit, in ethesi Terentius.”</span> In
this department of his art he shows that comprehensive knowledge
of the humours and inclinations of mankind, which
enabled him to delineate characters as well as manners, with
a genuine and apparently unstudied simplicity. All the inferior
passions which form the range of comedy are so nicely
observed, and accurately expressed, that we nowhere find a
truer or more lively representation of human nature. He
seems to have formed in his mind such a perfect idea both of
his high and low characters, that they never for a moment
forget their age or situation, whether they are to speak in
the easy indifferent tone of polished society, or with the natural
expression of passion. Nor do his paintings of character
consist merely of a single happy stroke unexpectedly introduced: 
His delineations are always in the right place, and so
harmonize with the whole, that every word is just what the
person might be supposed to say under the circumstances in
which he is placed:—

</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The characters, too, of Terence are never overstrained by
ridicule, which, if too much affected, produces creatures of
the fancy, which for a while may be more diverting than portraits
drawn from nature, but can never be so permanently
pleasing. This constitutes the great difference between Plautus
and Terence, as also between the new and old comedy of
the Greeks. The old comedy presented scenes of uninterrupted
gaiety and raillery and ridicule, and nothing was
spared which could become the object of sarcasm. The dramatic
school which succeeded it attracted applause by beauty
of situation and moral sentiment. In like manner, Terence
makes us almost serious by the interest and affection which
he excites for his characters. In the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Andria</span></span> we are touched
with all Pamphilus’ concern, we feel all his reflections to be
just, and pity his perplexity. The characters of Terence,
indeed, are of the same description with those of Plautus; but
his slaves and parasites and captains are not so farcical, nor
his panders and courtezans so coarse, as those of his predecessor.
The slave-dealers in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Adelphi</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phormio</span></span> are
rather merchants greedy of gain than shameless agents of
vice, and are not very different from Madame La Ressource,
in Regnard’s elegant comedy, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Le Joueur</span></span>. His courtezans,
instead of being invariably wicked and rapacious, are often
represented as good and beneficent. It was a courtezan who
received the dying mother of the Andrian, and, while expiring
herself, affectionately intrusted the orphan to the generous
protection of Pamphilus. It is a courtezan who, in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Eunuchus</span></span>,
discovers the family of the young Pamphila, and, in the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hecyra</span></span>, brings about the understanding essential to the happiness
of all. From their mode of life, and not interposing
much beyond their domestic circle, the manners of modest
women were not generally painted with any great taste by
the ancients; but Terence may perhaps be considered as an
exception. Nausistrata is an excellent picture of a matron not
of the highest rank or dignity, as is also Sostrata in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hecyra</span></span>. 
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The style of wit and humour must of course correspond with
that of the characters and manners. Accordingly, the plays
of Terence are not much calculated to excite ludicrous emotions,
and have been regarded as deficient in comic force.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page204">[pg 204]</span><a name="Pg204" id="Pg204" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>His muse is of the most perfect and elegant proportions, but
she fails in animation, and spirit. It was for this want of the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vis comica</span></span> that Terence was upbraided by Julius Cæsar, in
lines which, in other respects, bear a just tribute of applause
to this elegant dramatist:—

From the prologue to the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phormio</span></span> we learn that a clamour
had also been raised by his contemporaries against Terence,
because his dialogue was insipid, and wanted that comic
heightening which the taste of the age required:—
</p>

<div class="tei tei-lg" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em; margin-left: 2.00em; margin-top: 1.00em">

</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The plays of Terence, it must be admitted, are not calculated
to excite immoderate laughter, but his pleasantries are brightened
by all the charms of chaste and happy expression—thus
resembling in some measure the humour with which we are
so much delighted in the page of Addison, and which pleases
the more in proportion as it is studied and contemplated.
There are some parts of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Eunuchus</span></span> which I think cannot
be considered as altogether deficient in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vis comica</span></span>, as also
Demea’s climax of disasters in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Adelphi</span></span>, and a scene in
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Andria</span></span>, founded on the misconceptions of Mysis.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The beauties of style and language, I suppose, must be
considered as but secondary excellences in the drama. Were
they primary merits, Terence would deserve to be placed at
the head of all comic poets who have written for the stage,
on account of the consummate elegance and purity of his
diction. It is a singular circumstance, and without example
in the literary history of any other country, that the language
should have received its highest perfection, in point of elegance
and grace, combined with the most perfect simplicity,
from the pen of a foreigner and a slave. But it so happened, that
the countryman of Hannibal, and the freedman of Terentius
Lucanus, gave to the Roman tongue all those beauties, in a
degree which the courtiers of the Augustan age itself did not
surpass. Nor can this excellence be altogether accounted
for by his intimacy with Scipio and Lælius, in whose families
the Latin language was spoken with hereditary purity, since
it could only have been the merit of his dramas which first
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page205">[pg 205]</span><a name="Pg205" id="Pg205" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>attracted their regard; and indeed, from an anecdote above
related, of what occurred while reading his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Andria</span></span> to a dramatic
censor, it is evident that this play must have been written
ere he enjoyed the sunshine of patrician patronage. For
this <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ineffabilis amœnitas</span></span>, as it is called by Heinsius, he was
equally admired by his own contemporaries and by the writers
in the golden period of Roman literature. He is called by
Cæsar <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">puri sermonis amator</span></span>, and Cicero characterizes him
as—
</p>

<div class="tei tei-lg" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em; margin-left: 2.00em; margin-top: 1.00em">

<div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left"><span class="tei tei-q" style="text-align: left">“Quicquid come loquens, ac omnia dulcia dicens.”</span></div>

</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Even in the last age of Latin poetry, and when his pure simplicity
was so different from the style affected by the writers
of the day, he continued to be regarded as the model of correct
composition. Ausonius, in his beautiful poem addressed
to his grandson, hails him on account of his style, as the ornament
of Latium—
</p>

<div class="tei tei-lg" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em; margin-left: 2.00em; margin-top: 1.00em">

Among all the Latin writers, indeed, from Ennius to Ausonius,
we meet with nothing so simple, so full of grace and
delicacy—in fine, nothing that can be compared to the comedies
of Terence for elegance of dialogue—presenting a constant
flow of easy, genteel, unaffected discourse, which never
subsides into vulgarity or grossness, and never rises higher
than the ordinary level of polite conversation. Of this, indeed,
he was so careful, that when he employed any sentence
which he had found in the tragic poets, he stripped it of that
air of grandeur and majesty, which rendered it unsuitable for
common life, and comedy. In reading the dialogue of Simo
in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Andria</span></span>, and of Micio in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Adelphi</span></span>, we almost think
we are listening to the conversation of Scipio Africanus, and
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">mitis sapientia Læli</span></span>. The narratives, in particular, possess
a beautiful and picturesque simplicity. Cicero, in his
treatise <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De Oratore</span></span>, has bestowed prodigious applause on that
with which the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Andria</span></span> commences. <span class="tei tei-q">“The picture,”</span> he observes,
<span class="tei tei-q">“of the manners of Pamphilus—the death and funeral
of Chrysis—and the grief of her supposed sister, are all represented
in the most delightful colours.”</span>—Diderot, speaking
of the style of Terence, says, <span class="tei tei-q">“C’est une onde pure et transparente,
qui coule toujours egalement, et qui ne prend de
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page206">[pg 206]</span><a name="Pg206" id="Pg206" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>vitesse, que ce qu’elle en reçoit de la pente et du terrein.
Point d’esprit, nul etalage de sentiment, aucune sentence qui
ait l’air epigrammatique, jamais de ces definitions qui ne seroient
placées que dans Nicole ou la Rochefoucauld.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As to what may be strictly called the poetical style of
Terence, it has been generally allowed that he has used very
great liberties in his versification<a id="noteref_324" name="noteref_324" href="#note_324"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">324</span></span></a>. Politian divided his plays
(which in the MSS. resemble prose) into lines, but a separation
was afterwards more correctly made by Erasmus. Priscian
says, that Terence used more licenses than any other writer.
Bentley, after Priscian, admitted every variety of Iambic and
Trochaic measure; and such was the apparent number of
irregular quantities, and mixture of different species of verse,
that Westerhovius declares, that in order to reduce the lines
to their original accuracy, it would be necessary to evoke
Lælius and Scipio from the shades. Mr Hawkins, in his late
Inquiry into the Nature of Greek and Latin poetry, has attempted
to show that the whole doctrine of poetical licenses
is contrary to reason and common sense; that no such deviation
from the laws of prosody could ever have been introduced
by Terence; and that where his verses apparently require
licenses, they are either corrupt and ill-regulated, or may be
reduced to the proper standard, on the system of admitting
that all equivalent feet may come in room of the fundamental
feet or measures. On these principles, by changing the situation
of the quantities, by allowing that one long syllable may
stand for two short, or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vice versa</span></span>, there will not be occasion
for a single poetical license, which is in fact nothing less than
a breach of the rules of prosody.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
After having considered the plays of Plautus and of Terence,
one is naturally led to institute a comparison between
these two celebrated dramatists. People, in general, are very
apt to judge of the talents of poets by the absolute merits of
their works, without at all taking into view the relative circumstances
of their age and situation, or the progress of improvement
during the period in which they lived. No one recollects
that Tasso’s <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rinaldo</span></span> was composed in ten months, and
at the age of seventeen; and, in like manner, we are apt to forget
the difference between writing comedies while labouring at
a mill, and basking in the Alban villa of Scipio or Lælius. The
improvement, too, of the times, brought the works of Terence
to perfection and maturity, as much as his own genius. It is
evident, that he was chiefly desirous to recommend himself to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page207">[pg 207]</span><a name="Pg207" id="Pg207" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the approbation of a select few, who were possessed of true
wit and judgment, and the dread of whose censure ever kept
him within the bounds of correct taste; while the sole object
of Plautus, on the other hand, was to excite the merriment of
an audience of little refinement. If, then, we merely consider
the intrinsic merit of their productions, without reference
to the circumstances or situation of the authors, still
Plautus will be accounted superior in that vivacity of action,
and variety of incident, which raise curiosity, and hurry on
the mind to the conclusion. We delight, on the contrary, to
linger on every scene, almost on every sentence, of Terence.
Sometimes there are chasms in Plautus’s fables, and the incidents
do not properly adhere—in Terence, all the links of the
action depend on each other. Plautus has more variety in his
exhibition of characters and manners, but his pictures are often
overcharged, while those of Terence are never more highly
coloured than becomes the modesty of nature. Plautus’s
sentences have a peculiar smartness, which conveys the
thought with clearness, and strikes the imagination strongly,
so that the mind is excited to attention, and retains the idea
with pleasure; but they are often forced and affected, and of
a description little used in the commerce of the world; whereas
every word in Terence has direct relation to the business
of life, and the feelings of mankind. The language of Plautus
is more rich and luxuriant than that of Terence, but is far
from being so equal, uniform, and chaste. It is often stained
with vulgarity, and sometimes swells beyond the limits of
comic dialogue, while that of Terence is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">puro simillimus
amni</span></span>. The verses of Plautus are, as he himself calls them,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">numeri innumeri</span></span>; and Hermann declares, that, at least as now
printed, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">omni vitiorum genere abundant</span></span><a id="noteref_325" name="noteref_325" href="#note_325"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">325</span></span></a>. Terence attends
more to elegance and delicacy in the expression of passion—Plautus
to comic expression. In fact, the great object of
Plautus seems to have been to excite laughter among the audience,
and in this object he completely succeeded; but for
its attainment he has sacrificed many graces and beauties of
the drama. There are two sorts of humour—one consisting
in words and action, the other in matter. Now, Terence
abounds chiefly in the last species, Plautus in the first; and the
pleasantries of the older dramatist, which were so often flat,
low, or extravagant, finally drew down the censure of Horace,
while his successor was extolled by that poetical critic as the
most consummate master of dramatic art. <span class="tei tei-q">“In short,”</span> says
Crusius, <span class="tei tei-q">“Plautus is more gay, Terence more chaste—the first
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page208">[pg 208]</span><a name="Pg208" id="Pg208" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>has more genius and fire, the latter more manners and solidity.
Plautus excels in low comedy and ridicule, Terence in
drawing just characters, and maintaining them to the last.
The plots of both are artful, but Terence’s are more apt to
languish, whilst Plautus’s spirit maintains the action with
vigour. His invention was greatest; Terence’s, art and management.
Plautus gives the stronger, Terence a more elegant
delight. Plautus appears the better comedian of the
two, as Terence the finer poet. The former has more compass
and variety, the latter more regularity and truth, in his
characters. Plautus shone most on the stage; Terence
pleases best in the closet. Men of refined taste would prefer
Terence; Plautus diverted both patrician and plebeian<a id="noteref_326" name="noteref_326" href="#note_326"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">326</span></span></a>.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Some intimations of particular plays, both of Plautus and
Terence, have already been pointed out; but independently
of more obvious plagiarisms, these dramatists were the models
of all comic writers in the different nations of Europe, at the
first revival of the drama. Their works were the prototypes
of the regular Italian comedy, as it appeared in the plays
of Ariosto, Aretine, Ludovico Dolce, and Battista Porta. In
these, the captain and parasite are almost constantly introduced,
with addition of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pedante</span></span>, who is usually the pedagogue
of the young <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">innamorato</span></span>. Such erudite plays were
the only printed dramas (though the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Commedie dell’ Arte</span></span> 
were acted for the amusement of the vulgar,) till the beginning
of the 17th century, when Flaminio Scala first <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">published</span></span> 
his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Commedie dell’ Arte</span></span>. The old Latin plays were also the
models of the earliest dramas in Spain, previous to the introduction
of the comedy of intrigue, which was invented by
Lopez de Rueda, and perfected by Calderon. We find the
first traces of the Spanish drama in a close imitation of the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Amphitryon</span></span>, in 1515, by Villalobos, the physician of Charles
V., which was immediately succeeded by a version of Terence,
by Pedro de Abril, and translations of the Portuguese comedies
of Vasconcellos<a id="noteref_327" name="noteref_327" href="#note_327"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">327</span></span></a>, which were themselves written in the
manner of Plautus. There is likewise a good deal of the
spirit of Plautus and Terence in the old English comedy, particularly
in the characters. A panegyrist on Randolph’s
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Jealous Lovers</span></span>, which was published in 1632, says, <span class="tei tei-q">“that it
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page209">[pg 209]</span><a name="Pg209" id="Pg209" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>should be conserved in some great library, that if through
chance or injury of time, Plautus and Terence should be lost,
their united merit might be recognized. For, in this play,
thou hast drawn the pander, the gull, the jealous lover, the
doating father, the shark, and the crust wife.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The consideration of the servile manner in which the dramatists,
as well as novelists, of one country, have copied from
their predecessors in another, may be adduced in some degree
as a proof of the old philosophical aphorism, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Nihil est in intellectu
quod non prius fuerit in sensu</span></span>; and also of the incapacity
of the most active and fertile imagination, greatly to diversify
the common characters and incidents of life. One would
suppose, previous to examination, that the varieties, both of
character and situation, would be boundless; but on review,
we find a Plautus copying from the Greek comic writers, and,
in turn, even an Ariosto scarcely diverging from the track of
Plautus. When we see the same characters only in new
dresses, performing the same actions, and repeating the same
jests, we are tempted to exclaim, that everything is weary,
stale, flat, and unprofitable, and are taught a lesson of melancholy,
even from the Mask of Mirth.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
While Plautus, Cæcilius, Afranius, and Terence, raised the
comic drama to high perfection and celebrity, Pacuvius and
Attius attempted, with considerable success, the noblest subjects
of the Greek tragedies.

born at Brundusium, in the year 534. At Rome he became
intimately acquainted with Lælius, who, in Cicero’s treatise
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De Amicitiâ</span></span>, calls Pacuvius his host and friend: He also enjoyed,
like Terence, the intimacy of Scipio Africanus; but he
did not profit so much as the comic writer by his acquaintance
with these illustrious Romans for the improvement of
his style. There is an idle story, that Pacuvius had three
wives, all of whom successively hanged themselves on the
same tree; and that lamenting this to Attius, who was married,
he begged for a slip of it to plant in his own garden<a id="noteref_329" name="noteref_329" href="#note_329"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">329</span></span></a>;
an anecdote which has been very seriously confuted by Annibal 
di Leo, in his learned Memoir on Pacuvius. This poet
also employed himself in painting: he was one of the first of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page210">[pg 210]</span><a name="Pg210" id="Pg210" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the Romans who attained any degree of eminence in that elegant 
art, and particularly distinguished himself by the picture
which he executed for the temple of Hercules, in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Forum

He published his last piece at the age of eighty<a id="noteref_331" name="noteref_331" href="#note_331"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">331</span></span></a>;
after which, being oppressed with old age, and afflicted with
perpetual bodily illness, he retired, for the enjoyment of its
soft air and mild winters, to Tarentum<a id="noteref_332" name="noteref_332" href="#note_332"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">332</span></span></a>, where he died, having

supposed to have been written by himself, is quoted, with
much commendation, by Aulus Gellius, who calls it <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">verecundissimum

on a tombstone which stood by the side of a public road,
according to a custom of the Romans, who placed their monuments
near highways, that the spot where their remains were
deposited might attract observation, and the departed spirit
receive the valediction of passing travellers:

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Though a few fragments of the tragedies of Pacuvius remain,
our opinion of his dramatic merits can be formed only
at second hand, from the observations of those critics who
wrote while his works were yet extant. Cicero, though he
blames his style, and characterizes him as a poet <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">male loquutus</span></span><a id="noteref_336" name="noteref_336" href="#note_336"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">336</span></span></a>,
places him on the same level for tragedy as Ennius
for epic poetry, or Cæcilius for comedy; and he mentions, in
his treatise <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De Oratore</span></span>, that his verses were by many considered
as highly laboured and adorned.—<span class="tei tei-q">“Omnes apud hunc
ornati elaboratique sunt versus.”</span> It was in this laboured
polish of versification, and skill in the dramatic conduct of
the scene, that the excellence of Pacuvius chiefly consisted;
for so the lines of Horace have been usually interpreted,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page211">[pg 211]</span><a name="Pg211" id="Pg211" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>where, speaking of the public opinion entertained concerning
the different dramatic writers of Rome, he says,—

</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And the same meaning must be affixed to the passage in
Quintilian,—<span class="tei tei-q">“Virium tamen Attio plus tribuitur; Pacuvium

other Latin critics, though on the whole they seem to prefer
Attius, allow Pacuvius to be the more correct writer.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The names are still preserved of about 20 tragedies of Pacuvius—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Anchises</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Antiope</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Armorum Judicium</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Atalanta</span></span>,

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Thyestes</span></span>. Of these the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Antiope</span></span> was one of the most distinguished.
It was regarded by Cicero as a great national tragedy,
and an honour to the Roman name.—<span class="tei tei-q">“Quis enim,”</span>
says he, <span class="tei tei-q">“tam inimicus pene nomini Romano est, qui Ennii
Medeam, aut Antiopam Pacuvii, spernat, aut rejiciat?”</span> Persius,
however, ridicules a passage in this tragedy, where
Antiope talks of propping her melancholy heart with misfortunes,
by which she means, (I suppose,) that she fortunately
had so many griefs all around her heart, that it was well
bolstered up, and would not break or bend so easily as it
must have done, had it been supported by fewer distresses—

The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Armorum Judicium</span></span> was translated from Æschylus. With
regard to the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dulorestes</span></span>, (Orestes Servus,) there has been a
good deal of discussion and difficulty. Nævius, Ennius, and
Attius, are all said to have written tragedies which bore the
title of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dulorestes</span></span>; but a late German writer has attempted,
at great length, to show that this is a misconception; and that
all the fragments, which have been classed with the remains
of these three dramatic poets, belong to the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dulorestes</span></span> of
Pacuvius, who was in truth the only Latin poet who wrote a
tragedy with this appellation. What the tenor or subject of
the play, however, may have been, he admits is difficult to
determine, as the different passages, still extant, refer to very
different periods of the life of Orestes; which, I think, is rather
adverse to his idea, that all these fragments were written by
the same person, and belonged to the same tragedy, unless,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page212">[pg 212]</span><a name="Pg212" id="Pg212" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>indeed, Pacuvius had utterly set at defiance the observance of
the celebrated unities of the ancient drama. On the whole,
however, he agrees with Thomas Stanley, in his remarks on
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Chœphoræ</span></span> of Æschylus, that the subject of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Chœphoræ</span></span>,
which is the vengeance taken by Orestes on the murderers of
his father, is also that of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dulorestes</span></span> of Pacuvius<a id="noteref_338" name="noteref_338" href="#note_338"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">338</span></span></a>. Some

The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hermione</span></span> turned on the murder of Pyrrhus by Orestes
at the instigation of Hermione. Cicero, in his Treatise <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De
Amicitia</span></span>, mentions, in the person of Lælius, the repeated
acclamations which had recently echoed through the theatre
at the representation of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">new play</span></span> of his friend Pacuvius, in
that scene where Pylades and Orestes are introduced before
the king, who, being ignorant which of them is Orestes, whom
he had predetermined should be put to death, each insists, in
order to save the life of his friend, that he himself is the real
person in question. Delrio alleges that the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">new play</span></span> here
alluded to by Cicero was the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hermione</span></span>; but that play, as well
as the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dulorestes</span></span>, related to much earlier events than the
friendly contest between Pylades and Orestes, which took
place at the court of Thoas, King of Tauris, and was the concluding
scene in the dramatic life of Orestes, being long
subsequent to the murder of his mother, his trial in presence
of the Argives, or absolution at Athens before the Areopagus.
Accordingly, Tiraboschi states positively that this <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">new play</span></span> of
Pacuvius, which obtained so much applause, was his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pylades

In the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Iliona</span></span>, the scene where the shade of Polydorus, who
had been assassinated by the King of Thrace, appears to his
sister Iliona, was long the favourite of a Roman audience,
who seem to have indulged in the same partiality for such
spectacles as we still entertain for the goblins in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hamlet</span></span> and
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Macbeth</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
All the plays above mentioned were imitated or translated
by Pacuvius from the Greek. His <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Paulus</span></span>, however, was of
his own invention, and was the first Latin tragedy formed on
a Roman subject. Unfortunately there are only five lines of
it extant, and these do not enable us to ascertain, which Ro<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page213">[pg 213]</span><a name="Pg213" id="Pg213" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>man of the name of Paulus gave title to the tragedy. It was
probably either Paulus Æmilius, who fell at Cannæ, or his son,
whose story was a memorable instance of the instability of
human happiness, as he lost both his children at the moment
when he triumphed for his victory over Perseus of Macedon.

It does not appear that the tragedies of Pacuvius had much
success or popularity in his own age. He was obliged to have
recourse for his subjects to foreign mythology and unknown
history. Iphigenia and Orestes were always more or less
strangers to a Roman audience, and the whole drama in
which these and similar personages figured, never attained
in Rome to a healthy and perfect existence. Comedy, on the
other hand, addressed itself to the feelings of all. There were
prodigal sons, avaricious fathers, and rapacious courtezans, in
Rome as well as in Greece<a id="noteref_340" name="noteref_340" href="#note_340"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">340</span></span></a>. But it requires a certain cultivation
of mind and tenderness of heart to enjoy the representation
of a regular tragedy. The plebeians thronged to the
theatre for the sake of merriment, and the patricians were still
too much occupied with the projects of their own ambition,
to weep over the woes of Antigone or Electra.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Pacuvius, accordingly, had fewer imitators than Plautus.
Indeed, for a long period he had none of much note, except

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
or Accius, as he is sometimes, but improperly, called, who
brought forward his first play when thirty years old, in the
same season in which Pacuvius, having reached the age of
eighty, gave his last to the public<a id="noteref_341" name="noteref_341" href="#note_341"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">341</span></span></a>. Now, as Pacuvius would be
eighty in 614, Attius, according to this calculation, must have
been born in 584. It has been questioned, however, if he was
born so early, since Valerius Maximus relates a story of his
refusing to rise from his place on the entrance of Julius Cæsar
into the College of Poets, because in that place they did not
contest the prize of birth, but of learning<a id="noteref_342" name="noteref_342" href="#note_342"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">342</span></span></a>,—which disrespect,
if he came into the world in 584, he could not have survived
to offer to the dictator, Julius Cæsar, who was not born till 654.
This collector of anecdotes, however, may probably allude
either to some other poet of the name of Attius, or to some
other individual of the Julian family, than the Julius Cæsar
who subverted the liberties of his country. At all events it
is evident, that Attius lived to extreme old age. If born in
584, he must have been 63 years old at the birth of Cicero,
who came into the world in 647. Now, Cicero mentions not
only having seen him, but having heard from his own mouth
opinions concerning the eloquence of his friend D. Brutus, and
other speakers of his time<a id="noteref_343" name="noteref_343" href="#note_343"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">343</span></span></a>. Supposing this conversation took
place even when Cicero was so young as seventeen, Attius
must have lived at least to the age of eighty.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is certain, that Attius had begun to write tragedies before
the death of Pacuvius. Aulus Gellius relates, as a well-known
anecdote, that Attius, while on his way to Asia, was detained,
for some time at Tarentum, whither Pacuvius had retired, and
was invited to pass a few days with the veteran poet. During
his stay he read to his host the tragedy of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Atreus</span></span>, which was
one of his earliest productions. Pacuvius declared his verses
to be high sounding and lofty, but he remarked that they were
a little harsh, and wanted mellowness. Attius acknowledged
the truth of the observation, which he said gave him much
satisfaction; for that genius resembled apples, which when
produced hard and sour, grow mellow in maturity, while those
which are unseasonably soft do not become ripe, but rotten<a id="noteref_344" name="noteref_344" href="#note_344"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">344</span></span></a>.
His expectations, however, were scarcely fulfilled, and the
produce of his more advanced years was nearly as harsh as
what he had borne in youth. He seems, nevertheless, to have
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page215">[pg 215]</span><a name="Pg215" id="Pg215" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>entertained at all times a good opinion of his own poetical
talents: for, though a person of diminutive size, he got a huge
statue of himself placed in a conspicuous niche in the Temple
of the Muses<a id="noteref_345" name="noteref_345" href="#note_345"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">345</span></span></a>. Nor does his vanity appear to have exceeded
the high esteem in which he was held by his countrymen. Such
was the respect paid to him, that a player was severely punished
for mentioning his name on the stage<a id="noteref_346" name="noteref_346" href="#note_346"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">346</span></span></a>. Decius Brutus,
who was consul in 615, and was distinguished for his victories
in Spain, received him into the same degree of intimacy to
which Ennius had been admitted by the elder, and Terence
by the younger, Scipio Africanus: and such was his estimation
of the verses of this tragedian, that he inscribed them over the
entrance to a temple adorned by him with the spoils of enemies
whom he had conquered<a id="noteref_347" name="noteref_347" href="#note_347"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">347</span></span></a>. From the high opinion generally
entertained of the force and eloquence of his tragedies,
Attius was asked why he did not plead causes in the Forum;
to which he replied, that he made the characters in his tragedies
speak what he chose, but that, in the Forum, his adversaries
might say things he did not like, and which he could not
answer<a id="noteref_348" name="noteref_348" href="#note_348"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">348</span></span></a>.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Horace, in the same line where he celebrates the dramatic
skill of Pacuvius, alludes to the loftiness of Attius,—

expressed in the epithet applied to him by Ovid:—

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It would appear from Ovid likewise, that he generally chose
atrocious subjects for the arguments of his tragedies:—

By advice of Pacuvius, Attius adopted such subjects as had
already been brought forward on the Athenian stage; and we
accordingly find that he has dramatized the well-known sto<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page216">[pg 216]</span><a name="Pg216" id="Pg216" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>ries of Andromache, Philoctetes, Antigone, &amp;c. There are
larger fragments extant from these tragedies than from the

Most of the plays of Attius, as we have seen, were taken

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Brutus</span></span> and the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Decius</span></span>, hinged on Roman subjects, and were
both probably written in compliment to the family of his
patron, Decius Brutus. The subject of the former was the
expulsion of the Tarquins: but the only passage of it extant,
is the dream of Tarquin, and its interpretation, which have
been preserved by Cicero in his work <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De Divinatione</span></span>. Tarquin’s
dream was, that he had been overthrown by a ram
which a shepherd had presented to him, and that while lying
wounded on his back, he had looked up to the sky, and observed
that the sun, having changed his course, was journeying
from west to east. The first part of this dream being
interpreted, was a warning, that he would be expelled from
his kingdom by one whom he accounted as stupid as a sheep;
and the solar phenomenon portended a popular change in the
government. The interpreter adds, that such strange dreams
could not have occurred without the purpose of some special
manifestation, but that no attention need be paid to those
which merely present to us the daily transactions of life—

the patriotic self-devotion of Publius Decius, who, when his
army could no longer sustain the onset of the foe, threw
himself into the thickest of the combat, and was despatched
by the darts of the enemy. There were at least two of the
family of Decii, a father and son, who had successively devoted
themselves in this manner—the former in a contest with
the Latins, the latter in a war with the Gauls, leagued to the
Etruscans, in the year of Rome 457. No doubt, however,

the Romans, who were a national people, and whose epics
were generally founded on events in their own history, should,
when they did make such frequent attempts at the composition
of tragedy, have so seldom selected their arguments
from the ancient annals or traditions of their country. These
traditions were, perhaps, not very fertile in pathetic or mournful
incident, but they afforded subjects rich, beyond all
others, in tragic energy and elevation; and even in the range
of female character, in which the ancient drama was most
defective, Lucretia and Virginia were victims as interesting
as Iphigenia or Alcestis. The tragic writers of modern times
have borrowed from these very sources many subjects of
a highly poetical nature, and admirably calculated for scenic
representation. The furious combat of the Horatii and
Curiatii, the stern patriotic firmness of Brutus, the internal
conflicts of Coriolanus, the tragic fate of Virginia, and the
magnanimous self-devotion of Regulus, have been dramatized
with success, in the different languages of modern Europe.
But those names, which to us sound so lofty, may, to the
natives, have been too familiar for the dignity essential to
tragedy. In Rome, besides the risk of offending great families,
the Roman subjects were of too recent a date to have
acquired that venerable cast, which the tragic muse demands,
and time alone can bestow. They were not at sufficient
distance to have dropped all those mean and disparaging
circumstances, which unavoidably adhere to recent events, and
in some measure sink the noblest modern transactions to the
level of ordinary life. This seems to have been strongly felt
by Sophocles and Euripides, who preferred the incidents connected
with the sieges of Troy and of Thebes, rendered
gigantic only by the mists of antiquity, to the real and almost
living glories of Marathon or Thermopylæ. But the Romans
had no families corresponding to the race of Atreus or Œdipus—they 
had no princess endowed with the beauty of Helen—no 
monarch invested with the dignity of Agamemnon—they
had, in short, no epic cycle on which to form tragedies, like
the Greeks, whose minds had been conciliated by Homer in
favour of Ajax and Ulysses<a id="noteref_352" name="noteref_352" href="#note_352"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">352</span></span></a>. <span class="tei tei-q">“The most interesting subjects

kings were a detested race, for whose rank and qualities
there was no admiration, and for whose misfortunes there could
be no sympathy. Accordingly, after some few and not very
successful attempts to dramatize national incidents, the Latin
tragic writers relapsed into their former practice, as appears
from the titles of all the tragedies which were brought out
from the time of Attius to that of Seneca.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Hence it follows, that those remarks, which have been
repeated to satiety with regard to the subjects of the Greek
theatre, are likewise applicable to those of the Roman stage.
There would be the same dignified misfortune displayed in
nobler and imposing attitudes—the same observance of the
unities—the same dramatic phrensy, remorse, and love, proceeding
from the vengeance of the gods, and exhibited in the
fate of Ajax, Orestes, and Phædra—the same struggle against
that predominant destiny, which was exalted even above the
gods of Olympus, and by which the ill-fated race of Atreus
was agitated and pursued. The Latin, like the Greek tragedies,
must have excited something of the same feeling as the
Laocoon or Niobe in sculpture; and, indeed, the moral of a
large proportion of them seems to be comprised in the chorus
of Seneca’s <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Œdipus</span></span>—

M. Schlegel is of opinion, that had the Romans quitted the
practice of Greek translation, and composed original tragedies,
these would have been of a different cast and species
from the Greek productions, and would have been chiefly
expressive of profound religious sentiments.—<span class="tei tei-q">“La tragedie
Grecque avoit montré l’homme libre, combattant contre la
destinée; la tragedie Romaine eut presenté a nos regards
l’homme soumis a la Divinité, et subjugué jusques dans ses
penchans les plus intimes, par cette puissance infinie qui
sanctifie les ames, qui les enchaine de ses liens, et qui brille
de toutes parts, a travers le voile de l’univers<a id="noteref_354" name="noteref_354" href="#note_354"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">354</span></span></a>.”</span> His reasons
for supposing that this difference would have existed, are
founded on the difference in the mythological systems of the
two nations.—<span class="tei tei-q">“L’ancienne croyance des Romains et les
usages qui s’y rapportoient, renfermoient un sens moral, serieux,
philosophique, divinatoire et symbolique, qui n’existoit
pas dans la religion des Grecs.”</span> There can be no doubt,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page221">[pg 221]</span><a name="Pg221" id="Pg221" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>that the Romans were in public life, during the early periods
or their history, a devotedly religious people. Nothing of
moment was undertaken without being assured that the gods
approved, and would favour the enterprise. The utmost order
was observed in every step of religious performance. We see a
consul leaving his army, on suspicion of some irregularity, to
hold new auspices—an army inspired with sacred confidence
and ardour, after appeasing the wrath of the gods, by expiatory
lustrations—and a conqueror dedicating at his triumph the
temple vowed in the moment of danger. But notwithstanding
all this, it so happens, that a spirit of free-thinking is one of
the most striking characteristics of the oldest class of Latin
poets, particularly the tragedians, and in the fragments of
those very plays which were founded on Roman subjects,
there is everywhere expressed a bitter contempt for augury,
and for the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sens divinatoire et symbolique</span></span>, which they evidently
considered as quackery: and the dramatists do not seem
to have much scrupled to declare that it was so, or the people
to testify approbation of such sentiments. Even the almost
impious lines of Ennius, that the gods take no concern in the
affairs of mortals, were received, as we learn from Cicero,
with vast applause.—<span class="tei tei-q">“Noster Ennius, qui magno plausu
loquitur, assentiente populo—Ego Deûm genus<a id="noteref_355" name="noteref_355" href="#note_355"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">355</span></span></a>,”</span> &amp;c. It is
probable, however, that a tragedy purely Roman would have
been written in a different spirit from a Greek drama, because
the manners of the two people had little resemblance, and
because the Roman passion for freedom, detestation of tyranny,
and feelings of patriotism, had strong shades of
distinction from those of Greece. The self-devotion of the
Decii and Curtius, was of a fiercer description than that of
Leonidas. It was the headlong contempt, rather than the
resolute sacrifice, of existence.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was probably, too, from a slavish imitation of the Greek
dramatists, that the Latin tragedies acquired what is considered
one of their chief faults—the introduction of aphorisms
and moral sentences, which were not confined to the chorus,
the proper receptacle for them, (it being the peculiar office
and character of the chorus to moralize,) but were spread over
the whole drama in such a manner, that the characters appeared
to be <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vivendi preceptores</span></span> rather than <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">rei actores</span></span>. 
Quintilian characterizes Attius and Pacuvius as chiefly remarkable
for this practice.—<span class="tei tei-q">“Tragœdiæ scriptores Attius et
Pacuvius, clarissimi gravitate sententiarum.”</span> A question on
this point is started by Hurd,—That since the Greek trage<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page222">[pg 222]</span><a name="Pg222" id="Pg222" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>dians moralized so much, how shall we defend Sophocles, and
particularly Euripides, if we condemn Attius and Seneca?
Brumoy’s solution is, that the moral and political aphorisms
of the Greek stage generally contained some apt and interesting
allusion to the state of public affairs, easily caught by a
quick intelligent audience, and not a dry affected moral without
farther meaning, like most of the Latin maxims. In the
age, too, of the Greek tragedians, there was a prevailing fondness
for moral wisdom; and schools of philosophy were resorted
to for recreation as well as for instruction. Moral aphorisms,
therefore, were not inconsistent with the ordinary flow
of conversation in those times, and would be relished by such
as indulged in philosophical conferences, whereas such speculations
were not introduced till late in Rome, and were never
very generally in vogue.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On the whole, it may be admitted that the bold and animated
genius of Rome was well suited to tragedy, and that in
force of colouring and tragic elevation the Latin poets presented
not a feeble image of their great originals; but unfortunately
their judgment was uninformed, and they were too
easily satisfied with their own productions. Strength and fire
were all at which they aimed, and with this praise they remained
contented. They were careless with regard to the
regularity or harmony of versification. The discipline of correction,
the curious polishing of art, which had given such
lustre to the Greek tragedies, they could not bestow, or held
the emendation requisite for dramatic perfection as disgraceful
to the high spirit and energy of Roman genius<a id="noteref_356" name="noteref_356" href="#note_356"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">356</span></span></a>:

To originality or invention in their subjects, they hardly ever
presumed to aspire, and were satisfied with gathering what
they found already produced by another soil in full and ripened
maturity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It may perhaps appear strange that the Romans possessed
so little original talents for tragedy, and indeed for the drama
in general; but the genius of neighbouring nations, who had
equal success in other sorts of poetry, has often been very different
in this department of literature. The Spaniards could
boast of Lopez de Vega, Cervantes, and Calderon, at a time
when the Portuguese had no drama, and were contented with
the exhibitions of strolling players from Castile. Scotland
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page223">[pg 223]</span><a name="Pg223" id="Pg223" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>had scarcely produced a single play of merit in the brightest
age of the dramatic glory of England—the age of Shakspeare,
Massinger, and Jonson. While France was delighted with
the productions of Racine, Corneille, and Moliere, the modern
Italians, as if their ancestors’ poverty of dramatic genius still
adhered to them, though so rich and abundant in every other
department of literature, scarcely possessed a tolerable play
of their own invention, and till the time of Goldoni were
amused only with the most slavish imitations of the Latin
comedies, the buffooneries of harlequin, or tragedies of accumulated
and unmitigated horrors, which excite neither the
interest of terror nor of pity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For all this it may not be easy completely to account; but
various causes may be assigned for the want of originality in
Roman tragedy, and indeed in the whole Roman drama. The
nation was deficient in that milder humanity of which there are
so many beautiful instances in Grecian history. From the
austere patriotism of Brutus sacrificing every personal feeling
to the love of country,—from the frugality of Cincinnatus, and
parsimony of the Censor, it fell with frightful rapidity into a
state of luxury and corruption without example. Even during
the short period which might be called the age of refinement,
it wanted a poetical public. To judge by the early part of
their history, one would suppose that the Romans were not
deficient in that species of sensibility which fits for due sympathy
in theatrical incidents. Most of their great revolutions
were occasioned by events acting strongly and suddenly on
their feelings. The hard fate of Lucretia, Virginia, and the
youth Publilius, freed them from the tyranny of their kings,
decemvirs, and patrician creditors. On the whole, however,
they were an austere, stately, and formal people; their whole
mode of life tended to harden the heart and feelings, and there
was a rigid uniformity in their early manners, ill adapted to
the free workings of the passions. External indications of
tenderness were repressed as unbecoming of men whose souls
were fixed on the attainment of the most lofty objects. Pity
was never to be felt by a Roman, but when it came in the shape
of clemency towards a vanquished foe, and tears were never
to dim the eyes of those whose chief pride consisted in acting
with energy and enduring with firmness. This self-command,
which their principles required of them,—this control of
every manifestation of suffering in themselves, and contempt
for the expression of it in others, tended to exclude tragedy
almost entirely from the range of their literature.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Any softer emotions, too, which the Roman people may have
once experienced—any sentiments capable of being awakened
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page224">[pg 224]</span><a name="Pg224" id="Pg224" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to tragic pathos, became gradually blunted by the manner in
which they were exercised. They had, by degrees, been
accustomed to take a barbarous delight in the most wanton
displays of human violence, and brutal cruelty. Lions and
elephants tore each other in pieces before their eyes; and they
beheld, with emotions only of delight, crowds of hireling
gladiators wasting their energy, valour, and life, on the guilty
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">arena</span></span> of a Circus. Gladiatorial combats were first exhibited
by Decius and Marcus Brutus, at the funeral of their father,
about the commencement of the Punic wars. The number of
such entertainments increased with the luxury of the times;
and those who courted popular favour found no readier way
to gain it than by magnificence and novelty in this species of
expense. Cæsar exhibited three hundred pairs of gladiators;
Pompey presented to the multitude six hundred lions, to be
torn in pieces in the Circus, besides harnessed bears and
dancing elephants; and some other candidate for popular
favour, introduced the yet more refined barbarity of combats
between men and wild animals. These were the darling
amusements of all, and chief occupations of many Romans;
and those who could take pleasure in such spectacles, must
have lost all that tenderness of inward feeling, and all that
exquisite sympathy for suffering, without which none can
perceive the force and beauty of a tragic drama. The extension,
too, of the military power, and the increasing wealth
and splendour of the Roman republic, accustomed its citizens
to triumphal and gaudy processions. This led to a taste for
what, in modern times, has been called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Spectacle</span></span>; and, instead
of melting with tenderness at the woes of Andromache, the
people demanded on the stage such exhibitions as presented
them with an image of their favourite pastimes:—

</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This sort of show was not confined to the afterpiece or entertainment,
but was introduced in the finest tragedies, which
were represented with such pomp and ostentation as to destroy
all the grace of the performance. A thousand mules
pranced about the stage in the tragedy of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Clytemnestra</span></span>; and
whole regiments, accoutred in foreign armour, were marshalled
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page225">[pg 225]</span><a name="Pg225" id="Pg225" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>in that of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Trojan Horse</span></span><a id="noteref_359" name="noteref_359" href="#note_359"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">359</span></span></a>. This taste, so fatal to the
genuine excellence of tragedy or comedy, was fostered and
encouraged by the Ædiles, who had the charge of the public
Shows, and, among others, of the exhibitions at the theatre.
The ædileship was considered as one of the steps to the
higher honours of the state; and those who held it could not
resort to surer means of conciliating the favour of their fellow-citizens,
or purchasing their future suffrages, than by sparing
no expense in the pageantry of theatrical amusements.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The language, also, of the Romans, however excellent in
other respects, was at least in comparison with Greek, but ill
suited to the expression of earnest and vivid emotion. It required
an artful and elaborate collocation of words, and its
construction is more forced and artificial than that of most
other tongues. Hence passion always seemed to speak the
language with effort; the idiom would not yield to the rapid
transitions and imperfect phrases of impassioned dialogue.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Little attention, besides, was paid to critical learning, and
the cultivation of correct composition. The Latin muse had
been nurtured amid the festivities of rural superstition; and
the impure mixture of licentious jollity had so corrupted her
nature, that it long partook of her rustic origin. Even so late
as the time of Horace, the tragic drama continued to be unsuccessful,
in consequence of the illiberal education of the
Roman youth; who, while the Greeks were taught to open all
the mind to glory, were so cramped in their genius by the
love of gain, and by the early infusion of sordid principles,
that they were unable to project a great design, or conduct
it to perfection. The consequence was, that the <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ærugo et
cura peculi</span></span>”</span> had so completely infected the Roman dramatists,
that lucre was the sole object of their pains. Hence,
provided they could catch popular applause, and secure a high
price from the magistrates who superintended theatrical exhibitions,
they felt indifferent to every nobler view, and more
worthy purpose:—

</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But, above all, the low estimation in which the art of poetry
was held, must be regarded as a cause of its little progress
during the periods of the republic: <span class="tei tei-q">“Sero igitur,”</span> says Cicero,
<span class="tei tei-q">“a nostris, poetæ vel cogniti vel recepti. Quo minus igitur
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page226">[pg 226]</span><a name="Pg226" id="Pg226" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>honoris erat poetis, eo minora studia fuerunt<a id="noteref_361" name="noteref_361" href="#note_361"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">361</span></span></a>.”</span> The earliest
poets of Rome had not the encouragement of that court favour
which was extended to Chaucer in England, to Marot and
Ronsard in France, and to Dante by the petty princes of Italy.
From Livius Andronicus to Terence, poetry was cultivated
only by foreigners and freedmen. Scipio and Lælius, indeed,
are said to have written some scenes in the plays of Terence;
but they did not choose that anything of this sort should pass
under their names. The stern republicans seem to have considered
poetry as an art which captives and slaves might cultivate,
for the amusement of their conquerors, or masters, but
which it would be unsuitable for a grave and lofty patrician
to practice. I suspect, the Romans regarded a poet as a tumbler
or rope-dancer, with whose feats we are entertained, but
whom we would not wish to imitate.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The drama in Rome did not establish itself systematically,
and by degrees, as it did in Greece. Plautus wrote for the
stage during the time of Livius Andronicus, and Terence was
nearly contemporary with Pacuvius and Attius; so that everything
serious and comic, good and bad, came at once, and if
it was Grecian, found a welcome reception among the Romans.
On this account every species of dramatic amusement was indiscriminately
adopted at the theatre, and that which was most
absurd was often most admired. The Greek drama acquired
a splendid degree of perfection by a close imitation of nature;
but the Romans never attained such perfection, because,
however exquisite their models, they did not copy directly
from nature, but from its representative and image.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Had the Romans, indeed, possessed a literature of their own,
when they first grew familiar with the works of the Greek
poets, their native productions would no doubt have been improved
by the study and imitation of the masterpieces of these
more accomplished foreigners; yet they would still have preserved
something of a national character. But, unfortunately,
when the Romans first became acquainted with the writings
of the Greeks, they had not even sown the seeds of learning,
so that they remained satisfied with the full-ripened produce
imported from abroad. Several critics have indeed remarked
in all the compositions of the Romans, and particularly in their
tragedies, a peculiar severity and loftiness of thought; but
they were all formed so entirely on a Greek model, that their
early poetry must be regarded rather as the production of art
than genius, and as a spark struck by contact and attrition,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page227">[pg 227]</span><a name="Pg227" id="Pg227" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>rather than a flame spontaneously kindled at the altar of the
Muses.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In addition to all this, the Latin poet had no encouragement
to invent. He was not required to look abroad into
nature, or strike out a path for himself. So far from this
being demanded, Greek subjects were evidently preferred by
the public—

All the works, then, which have been hitherto mentioned,
and which, with exception of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Annals</span></span> of Ennius, are entirely
dramatic, belong strictly to what may be called the
Greek school of composition, and are unquestionably the least
original class of productions in the Latin, or perhaps any
other language. But however little the early dramatists of
Rome may have to boast of originality or invention, they are
amply entitled to claim an unborrowed praise for the genuine
purity of their native style and language.

The style and language of the dramatic writers of the period,
on which we are now engaged, seem to have been much
relished by a numerous class of readers, from the age of Augustus
to that of the Antonines, and to have been equally
abhorred by the poets of that time. We have already seen
Horace’s indignation against those who admired the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Carmen

But although a great proportion of the public may, with malicious
designs, have heaped extravagant commendations on
the style of the ancient tragedians, there can be no doubt
that it is full of vigour and richness; and if inferior to the
exquisite refinement of the Augustan age, it was certainly
much to be preferred to the obscurity of Persius, or the conceits
of Martial. <span class="tei tei-q">“A very imperfect notion,”</span> says Wakefield,
in one of his letters to Fox, <span class="tei tei-q">“is entertained in general of the
copiousness of the Latin language, by those who confine
themselves to what are styled the Augustan writers. The
old comedians and tragedians, with Ennius and Lucilius, were
the great repositories of learned and vigorous expression. I
have ever regarded the loss of the old Roman poets, particularly
Ennius and Lucilius, from the light they would have
thrown on the formations of the Latin language, and its derivation
from the Æolian Greek, as the severest calamity ever
sustained by philological learning<a id="noteref_364" name="noteref_364" href="#note_364"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">364</span></span></a>.”</span> Sometimes, indeed, their
words are uncouth, particularly their compound terms <a name="corr228" id="corr228" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">and</span> epithets, in the formation of which they are not nearly so
happy as the Greeks. Livius Andronicus uses <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Odorisequos

Such terms always appear incongruous and disjointed,

words of the Greeks.

On the whole, it seems pretty evident, that the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">regular</span></span> drama
was divided into tragedy and comedy. A tragedy on a Greek
subject, and in which Greek manners were preserved, as the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page229">[pg 229]</span><a name="Pg229" id="Pg229" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Hecuba, Dulorestes, &amp;c. was simply styled <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tragœdia</span></span>, or
sometimes <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tragœdia Palliata</span></span>. Those tragedies again, in
which Roman characters were introduced, as the Decius and
Brutus of Attius, were called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Prætextatæ</span></span>, because the Prætexta
was the habit worn by Roman kings and consuls. The
comedy which adopted Greek subjects and characters, like
those of Terence, was termed <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Comœdia</span></span>, or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Comœdia Palliata</span></span>;
and that which was clothed in Roman habits and customs,
was called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Togata</span></span><a id="noteref_366" name="noteref_366" href="#note_366"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">366</span></span></a>. Afranius was the most celebrated writer
of this last class of dramas, which were probably Greek
pieces accommodated to Roman manners, since Afranius lived
at a period when Roman literature was almost entirely imitative.
It is difficult, no doubt, to see how an Athenian comedy
could be bent to local usages foreign to its spirit and genius;
but the Latin writers were not probably very nice about the adjustment;
and the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Comœdia Togata</span></span> is so slightly mentioned by
ancient writers, that we can hardly suppose that it comprehended
a great class of national compositions. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tabernaria</span></span> was
a comedy of a lower order than the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Comœdia Togata</span></span>: It
represented such manners as were likely to be met with among
the dregs of the Plebeians; and was so called from Taberna,
as its scene was usually laid in shops or taverns. These, I
think, are the usual divisions of the regular Roman drama;
but critics and commentators have sometimes applied the
term <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Togata</span></span> to all plays, whether tragedies or comedies, in
which Roman characters were represented, and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Palliata</span></span> to
every drama of Greek origin.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There was, however, a species of irregular dramas, for
which the Romans were not indebted to the Greeks, and
which was peculiar to themselves, called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Fabulæ Atellanæ</span></span>.
These entertainments were so denominated from Atella, a
considerable town of the Oscans, now St Arpino, lying about
two miles south from Aversa, between Capua and Naples,—the
place now named Atella being at a little distance.

When Livius Andronicus had succeeded in establishing at
Rome a regular theatre, which was formed on the Greek
model, and was supported by professional writers, and professional
actors, the free Roman youth, who were still willing,
amid their foreign refinements, occasionally to revive the
recollection of the old popular pastimes of their Italian ancestry,
continued to amuse themselves with the satiric pieces
introduced by the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Histrions</span></span> of Etruria, and with the Atellane
Fables which Oscan performers had first made known at
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page230">[pg 230]</span><a name="Pg230" id="Pg230" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Rome<a id="noteref_367" name="noteref_367" href="#note_367"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">367</span></span></a>. The actors of the regular drama were not permitted
to appear in such representations; and the Roman youths, to
whom the privilege was reserved, were not, as other actors,
removed from their tribe, or rendered incapable of military
service<a id="noteref_368" name="noteref_368" href="#note_368"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">368</span></span></a>; nor could they be called on like them to unmask
in presence of the spectators<a id="noteref_369" name="noteref_369" href="#note_369"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">369</span></span></a>. It has been conjectured, that
the popularity of these spectacles, and the privileges reserved
to those who appeared in them, were granted in consequence
of their pleasantries being so tempered by the ancient Italian
gravity, that there was no admixture of obscenity or indecorum,
and hence no stain of dishonour was supposed to be
inflicted on the performers<a id="noteref_370" name="noteref_370" href="#note_370"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">370</span></span></a>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Atellane Fables consisted of detached scenes following
each other, without much dramatic connection, but replete
with jocularity and buffoonery. They were written in the
Oscan dialect, in the same way as the Venetian or Neapolitan
jargons are frequently employed in the Italian comedies; and
they differed from the Greek satiric drama in this, that the
characters of the latter were Satyrs, while those of the Atellane
fables were Oscan<a id="noteref_371" name="noteref_371" href="#note_371"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">371</span></span></a>. One of these was called Maccus,
a grotesque and fantastic personage, with an immense head,
long nose, and hump back, who corresponded in some measure
to the clown or fool of modern pantomime, and whose appellation
of Maccus has been interpreted by Lipsius as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bardus</span></span>, 
    <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">fatuus</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">stolidus</span></span><a id="noteref_372" name="noteref_372" href="#note_372"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">372</span></span></a>. In its rude but genuine form this species of
entertainment was in great vogue and constant use at Rome.
It does not appear that the Atellane fables were originally
written out, or that the actors had certain parts prescribed
to them. The general subject was probably agreed on, but
the performers themselves filled up the scenes from their own
art or invention<a id="noteref_373" name="noteref_373" href="#note_373"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">373</span></span></a>. As the Roman language improved, and
the provincial tongues of ancient Italy became less known,
the Oscan dialect was gradually abandoned. Quintus Novius,
who lived in the beginning of the seventh century of Rome,
and whom Macrobius mentions as one of the most approved
writers of Atellane Fables, was the author who chiefly con<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page231">[pg 231]</span><a name="Pg231" id="Pg231" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>tributed to this innovation. He is cited as the author of the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Virgo Prægnans</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dotata</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Gallinaria</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Gemini</span></span>, and various
others.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At length, in the time of Sylla, Lucius Pomponius produced
Atellane Fables, which were written without any intermixture
of the Oscan dialect, being entirely in the Latin
language; and he at the same time refined their ancient buffoonery
so much, by giving them a more rational cast, that
he is called by Velleius Paterculus the inventor of this species
of drama, and is characterized by that author as <span class="tei tei-q">“sensibus
celebrem, verbis rudem<a id="noteref_374" name="noteref_374" href="#note_374"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">374</span></span></a>.”</span> Pomponius was remarkable for
his accurate observation of manners, and his genius has been
highly extolled by Cicero and Seneca. The names of sixty-three
of his pieces have been cited by grammarians, and from
all these fragments are still extant. From some of them,
however, not more than a line has been preserved, and from
none of them more than a dozen. It would appear that the
Oscan character of Maccus was still retained in many fables
of Pomponius, as there is one entitled <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Maccus</span></span>, and others
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Macci Gemini</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Maccus Miles</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Maccus Sequestris</span></span>, in the
same manner as we say Harlequin footman, &amp;c. Pappo, or
Pappus, seems also to have been a character introduced along
with Maccus, and, I should think, corresponded to the Pantaloon
of modern pantomime. Among the names of the Atellanes
of Pomponius we find <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pappus Agricola</span></span>, and among
those of Novius, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pappus Præteritus</span></span>. This character, however,
appears rather to have been of Greek than of Oscan
origin; and was probably derived from <span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-family: Gentium, 'New Athena Unicode', 'DejaVu Serif', 'Lucida Grande', 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Palatino Linotype', serif">Παππος</span></span>, the Silenus
or old man of the Greek dramatic satire.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The improvements of Pomponius were so well received at
Rome, that he was imitated by Mummius, and by Sylla himself,
who, we are told by Athenæus, wrote several Atellane
Fables in his native language<a id="noteref_375" name="noteref_375" href="#note_375"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">375</span></span></a>. In this new form introduced
by Pomponius the Atellane dramas continued to enjoy great
popularity in Rome, till they were in some measure superseded
by the Mimes of Laberius and Publius Syrus.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Along with the Atellane Fables, the Roman youth were in
the practice of acting short pieces called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Exodia</span></span>, which were
interludes, or after-pieces, of a yet more loose, detached, and
farcical description, than the Atellanes, being a continuation
of the ancient performances originally introduced by the Histrions
of Etruria<a id="noteref_376" name="noteref_376" href="#note_376"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">376</span></span></a>. In these Exodia the actors usually wore
the same masks and habits as in the Atellanes and tragedies<a id="noteref_377" name="noteref_377" href="#note_377"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">377</span></span></a>,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page232">[pg 232]</span><a name="Pg232" id="Pg232" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and represented the same characters in a ludicrous point of
view:—

Joseph Scaliger, in his Commentary on Manilius, gives his
opinion, that the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Exodia</span></span> were performed at the end of the
principal piece, like our farces, and were so called as being
the issue of the entertainment, which is also asserted by a
scholiast on Juvenal<a id="noteref_379" name="noteref_379" href="#note_379"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">379</span></span></a>. But the elder Scaliger and Salmasius
thought that the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">exodium</span></span> was a sort of interlude, and had not
necessarily any connection with the principal representation.
The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Exodia</span></span> continued to be performed with much license in
the times of Tiberius and Nero; and when the serious spirit
of freedom had vanished from the empire, they often contained
jocular but direct allusions to the crimes of the portentous
monsters by whom it was scourged and afflicted.

the term may be of Latin origin, it does not follow that the
thing was unknown to the Greeks,—and that he also relies
too much on the argument, that the satiric plays of the Greeks
were quite different from the satire of the Romans, which may
be true; while, at the same time, there are other sorts of
Greek compositions, as the lyric satires of Archilochus and the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Silli</span></span>, which have a much nearer resemblance to the Latin
didactic satire than any satirical drama.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In fact, the whole question seems to depend on what constitutes
a sufficient alteration or variety from former compositions,
to give a claim to invention. Now it certainly cannot
be pretended, so far as we know, that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">any</span></span> satiric productions
of the Greeks had much resemblance to those of the Romans.
The Greek satires, which are improperly so termed, were
divided into what were called tragic and comic. The former
were dramatic compositions, which had their commencement,
like the regular tragedy, in rustic festivals to the honour of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page234">[pg 234]</span><a name="Pg234" id="Pg234" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Bacchus; and in which, characters representing Satyrs, the
supposed companions of that god, were introduced, imitating
the coarse songs and fantastic dances of rural deities. In
their rude origin, it is probable that only one actor, equipped
as a Satyr, danced or sung. Soon, however, a chorus
appeared, consisting of the bearded and beardless Satyrs,
Silenus, and Pappo Silenus; and Histrions, representing heroic
characters, were afterwards introduced. The satiric drama
began to flourish when the regular tragedy had become too
refined to admit of a chorus, or accompaniment of Satyrs, but
while these were still remembered with a sort of fondness,
which rendered it natural to recur to the most ancient shape
of the drama. In this state of the progress of the Greek stage,
the satire was performed separately from the tragedy; and out
of respect to the original form of tragedy, was often exhibited
as a continuation or parody of the tragic <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">trilogy</span></span>, or three
serious plays,—thus completing what was called the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">tetralogia</span></span>.
The scene of these satires was laid in the country,
amid woods, caves, and mountains, or other such places as
Satyrs were supposed to inhabit; and the subjects chosen
were those in which Satyrs might naturally be feigned to have
had a share or interest. High mythological stories and fabulous
heroes were introduced, as appears from the names
preserved by Casaubon, who mentions the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hercules</span></span> of Astydamas,
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Alcmæon</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vulcan</span></span> of Achæus,—each of which
is denominated <span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-family: Gentium, 'New Athena Unicode', 'DejaVu Serif', 'Lucida Grande', 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Palatino Linotype', serif">σατυρικος</span></span>. These heroic characters, however,
were generally parodied, and rendered fantastic, by the gross
railleries of Silenus and the Fauns. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cyclops</span></span> of Euripides,
which turns on the story of Ulysses in the cave of
Polyphemus, is the only example entirely extant of this species
of composition. Some fragments, however, remain of the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lytiersa</span></span> of Sositheus, an author who flourished about the
130th Olympiad, which was subsequent to the introduction of
the new Greek comedy. Lytiersa, who gives name to this
dramatic satire, lived in Phrygia. He used to receive many
guests, who flocked to his residence from all quarters. After
entertaining them at sumptuous banquets, he compelled them
to go out with him to his fields, to reap his crop or cut his
hay; and when they had performed this labour, he mowed off
their heads, with a scythe. The style of entertainment, it
seems, did not prevent his house from being a place of
fashionable resort. Hercules, however, put an end to this
mode of wishing a good afternoon, by strangling the hospitable
landlord, and throwing his body into the Mæander. It is
evident, from the subject of this play, and of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cyclops</span></span>, that
the tragic satires were a sort of fee-fa-fum performance, like
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page235">[pg 235]</span><a name="Pg235" id="Pg235" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>our after-pieces founded on the stories of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Blue Beard</span></span> and
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Jack the Giant Killer</span></span>. They were generally short and simple
in their plan: They contained no satire or ridicule against the
fellow-citizens of the author, or any private individuals whatever;
but there was a good deal of jeering by the characters
at each other, and much buffoonery, revelling, and indecency,
among the satiric persons of the chorus.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Comic Satire began later than the Tragic, subsisted
for some time along with it, and finally survived it. In Greece
it was chiefly popular after the time of Alexander, and it also
flourished in the court of the Egyptian Ptolemies. It was quite
different from the Tragic Satire; the action being laid in
cities, or at least not always amid rustic scenes. Private individuals
were often satirized in it, and not unfrequently the
tyrants or rulers of the state. When a mythic story was
adopted, the affairs of domestic life were conjoined with the
action, and it never was of the same enormous or bloody nature
as the fables employed in the tragic satire, but such subjects
were usually chosen as that of Amphitryon, Apollo feeding the
flocks of Admetus, &amp;c. Satyrs were not essential characters,
and when they were introduced, private individuals were
generally intended to be ridiculed, under the form of these
rustic divinities. Gluttony, to judge from some fragments
preserved by Athenæus, was one of the chief topics of banter
and merriment. Timocles, who lived about the 114th Olympiad,
was the chief author of comic satires. Lycophron, better
known by his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cassandra</span></span>, also wrote one called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Menedemus</span></span>,
in which the founder of the Eretric school of philosophy 
was exposed to ridicule, under the character of Silenus, and
his pupils under the masks of Satyrs.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Besides their dramatic satires, the Greeks had another species
of poem called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Silli</span></span>, which were patched up like the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cento Nuptialis</span></span> of Ausonius from the verses of serious writers,
and by such means turned to a different sense from what their
original author intended. Thus, in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Silli</span></span> attributed to
Timon, a sceptic philosopher and disciple of Pyrrho, who lived
in the time of Ptolemy Philadelphus, the lines are copied from
Homer and the tragic poets, but they are satirically applied to
certain customs and systems of philosophy, which it was his
object to ridicule. Some specimens of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Silli</span></span> may be found
in Diogenes Laertius; but the longest now extant is a passage
preserved in Dio Chrysostom, exposing the mad attachment
of the inhabitants of Alexandria to chariot races. To these
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Silli</span></span> may be added the lyric or iambic satires directed against
individuals, like those of Archilochus against Lycambes.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Roman didactic satire had no great resemblance to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page236">[pg 236]</span><a name="Pg236" id="Pg236" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>any of these sorts of Greek satire. It referred, as every one
knows, to the daily occurrences of life,—to the ordinary follies
and vices of mankind. With the Greek tragic satire it
had scarce any analogy whatever; for it was not in dialogue,
and contained no allusion to the mythological Satyrs who formed
the chorus of the Greek dramas. To the comic satire it
had more affinity; and those writers who have maintained the
Greek origin of Roman satire have done little justice to their
argument by not attending to the distinction between these
two sorts of dramatic satire, and treating the whole question
as if it depended on the resemblance to the tragic satire. In
the comic satire, as we have seen, Satyrs were not always nor
necessarily introduced. The subject was taken from ordinary
life; and domestic vice or absurdity was stigmatized and
ridiculed, as it was in the Roman satire, particularly during its
earliest ages. Still, however, there was no incident or plot
evolved in a Roman satire; nor was it written in dialogue,
except occasionally, for the sake of more lively sarcasm on
life and manners.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But though the Roman satire took a different direction, it
had something of the same origin as the satiric drama of the
Greeks. As the Grecian holidays were celebrated with oblations
to Bacchus and Ceres, to whose bounty they owed their
wine and corn, in like manner the ancient Italians propitiated
their agricultural or rustic deities with appropriate offerings,

Ennius, perceiving how much the Romans had been delighted
with the rude satires poured forth in extemporary dialogue,
thought it might be worth his pains to compose satires
not to be recited but read. He preserved in them, however,
the groundwork of the ancient pleasantry, and the venom of
the ancient raillery, on individuals, as well as on general vices.
His satires related to various subjects, and were written in
different sorts of verses—hexameters being mingled with
iambic and trochaic lines, as fancy dictated.

Unfortunately, however, the writings of Lucilius are so mutilated,
that few particulars of his life and manners can be
gleaned from them. Little farther is known concerning him,
than that he died at Naples, but at what age has been much
disputed. Eusebius and most other writers have fixed it at 45,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page239">[pg 239]</span><a name="Pg239" id="Pg239" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>which, as he was born in 605, would be in the 651st year of
the city. But M. Dacier and Bayle<a id="noteref_401" name="noteref_401" href="#note_401"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">401</span></span></a> assert that he must have
been much older, at the time of his death, as he speaks in his
satires of the Licinian law against exorbitant expenditure at
entertainments, which was not promulgated till 657, or 658.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Satire, more than any other species of poetry, is the offspring
of the time in which it has its birth, and which furnishes
it with the aliment whereon it feeds. The period at which
Lucilius appeared was favourable to satiric composition.
There was a struggle existing between the old and new manners,
and the freedom of speaking and writing, though restrained,
had not yet been totally checked by law. Lucilius
lived amidst a people on whom luxury and corruption were
advancing with fearful rapidity, but among whom some virtuous
citizens were still anxious to stem the tide which threatened
to overwhelm their countrymen. The satires of Lucilius were
adapted to please these staunch <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">laudatores temporis acti</span></span>,”</span> 
who stood up for ancient manners and discipline. The freedom
with which he attacked the vices of his contemporaries,
without sparing individuals,—the strength of colouring with
which his pictures were charged,—the weight and asperity of
the reproaches with which he loaded those who had exposed
themselves to his ridicule or indignation,—had nothing revolting
in an age when no consideration compelled to those
forbearances necessary under different forms of society or
government<a id="noteref_402" name="noteref_402" href="#note_402"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">402</span></span></a>. By the time, too, in which Lucilius began to
write, the Romans, though yet far from the polish of the Augustan
age, had become familiar with the delicate and cutting
irony of the Greek comedies of which the more ancient Roman
satirists had no conception. Lucilius chiefly applied himself
to the imitation of these dramatic productions, and caught, it
is said, much of their fire and spirit:

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Roman language, likewise, had grown more refined in the
age of Lucilius, and was thus more capable of receiving the
Grecian beauties of style. Nor did Lucilius, like his prede<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page240">[pg 240]</span><a name="Pg240" id="Pg240" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>cessors, mix iambic with trochaic verses. Twenty books of
his satires, from the commencement, were in hexameter verse,
and the rest, with exception of the thirtieth, in iambics or trochaics.
His object, too, seems to have been bolder and more
extensive than that of his precursors, and was not so much to
excite laughter or ridicule, as to correct and chastise vice.
Lucilius thus bestowed on satiric composition such additional
grace and regularity, that he is declared by Horace to have
been the first among the Romans who wrote satire in verse:—
</p>

<div class="tei tei-lg" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em; margin-left: 2.00em; margin-top: 1.00em">

</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But although Lucilius may have greatly improved this sort of
writing, it does not follow that his satires are to be considered
as altogether of a different species from those of Ennius—a
light in which they have been regarded by Casaubon and Ruperti;
<span class="tei tei-q">“for,”</span> as Dryden has remarked, <span class="tei tei-q">“it would thence follow,
that the satires of Horace are wholly different from those
of Lucilius, because Horace has no less surpassed Lucilius in
the elegance of his writing, than Lucilius surpassed Ennius in
the turn and ornament of his.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The satires of Lucilius extended to not fewer than thirty
books; but whether they were so divided by the poet himself,
or by some grammarian who lived shortly after him, seems
uncertain: He was a voluminous author, and has been satirized
by Horace for his hurried copiousness and facility:—

Of the thirty books there are only fragments extant; but these
are so numerous, that though they do not capacitate us to
catch the full spirit of the poet, we perceive something of
his manner. His merits, too, have been so much canvassed
by ancient writers, who judged of them while his works
were yet entire, that their discussions in some measure enable
us to appreciate his poetical claims. It would appear that
he had great vivacity and humour, uncommon command of
language, intimate knowledge of life and manners, and considerable
acquaintance with the Grecian masters. Virtue
appeared in his draughts in native dignity, and he exhibited
his distinguished friends, Scipio and Lælius, in the most amiable
light. At the same time it was impossible to portray
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page241">[pg 241]</span><a name="Pg241" id="Pg241" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>anything more powerful than the sketches of his vicious characters.
His rogue, glutton, and courtezan, are drawn in
strong, not to say coarse colours. He had, however, much
of the old Roman humour, that celebrated but undefined <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">urbanitas</span></span>,
which indeed he possessed in so eminent a degree,
that Pliny says it began with Lucilius in composition<a id="noteref_405" name="noteref_405" href="#note_405"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">405</span></span></a>, while
Cicero declares that he carried it to the highest perfection<a id="noteref_406" name="noteref_406" href="#note_406"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">406</span></span></a>,
and that it almost expired with him<a id="noteref_407" name="noteref_407" href="#note_407"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">407</span></span></a>. But the chief characteristic
of Lucilius was his vehement and cutting satire. Macrobius
calls him <span class="tei tei-q">“Acer et violentus poeta<a id="noteref_408" name="noteref_408" href="#note_408"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">408</span></span></a>;”</span> and the well-known
lines of Juvenal, who relates how he made the guilty
tremble by his pen, as much as if he had pursued them sword
in hand, have fixed his character as a determined and inexorable
persecutor of vice. His Latin is admitted on all hands
to have been sufficiently pure<a id="noteref_409" name="noteref_409" href="#note_409"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">409</span></span></a>; but his versification was rugged
and prosaic. Horace, while he allows that he was more
polished that his predecessors, calls his muse <span class="tei tei-q">“pedestris,”</span>
talks repeatedly of the looseness of his measure, <span class="tei tei-q">“Incomposito
pede currere versus,”</span> and compares his whole poetry to a
muddy and troubled stream:—

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Quintilian does not entirely coincide with this opinion of
Horace; for, while blaming those who considered him as the
greatest of poets, which some persons still did in the age of
Domitian, he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“Ego quantum ab illis, tantum ab Horatio

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As to the learning of Lucilius, the opinions of antiquity were
different; and even those of the same author appear somewhat
contradictory on this point. Quintilian says, that there is
<span class="tei tei-q">“Eruditio in eo mira.”</span> Cicero, in his treatise <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De Finibus</span></span>,
calls his learning <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">mediocris</span></span>; though, afterwards, in the person
of Crassus, in his treatise <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De Oratore</span></span>, he twice terms him
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Doctus</span></span><a id="noteref_412" name="noteref_412" href="#note_412"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">412</span></span></a>. Dacier suspects that Quintilian was led to consider
Lucilius as learned, from the pedantic intermixture of Greek
words in his compositions—a practice which seems to have
excited the applause of his contemporaries, and also of his
numerous admirers in the Augustan age, for which they
have been severely ridiculed by Horace, who always warmly
opposed himself to the excessive partiality entertained for
Lucilius during that golden period of literature—

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is not unlikely that there may have been something of
political spleen in the admiration expressed for Lucilius during
the age of Augustus, and something of courtly complaisance
in the attempts of Horace to counteract it. Augustus
had extended the law of the 12 tables respecting libels; and
the people, who found themselves thus abridged of the liberty
of satirizing the Great by name, might not improbably seek
to avenge themselves by an overstrained attachment to the
works of a poet, who, living as they would insinuate, in better
times, practised, without fear, what he enjoyed without
restraint<a id="noteref_413" name="noteref_413" href="#note_413"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">413</span></span></a>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Some motive of this sort doubtless weighed with the Romans
in the age of Augustus, since much of the satire of
Lucilius must have been unintelligible, or at least uninteresting
to them. Great part of his compositions appears to
have been rather a series of libels than legitimate satire, being
occupied with virulent attacks on contemporary citizens
of Rome—

Douza, who has collected and edited all that remains of the
satires of Lucilius, mentions the names of not fewer than sixteen
individuals, who are attacked by name in the course even
of these fragments, among whom are Quintus Opimius, the
conqueror of Liguria, Cæcilius Metellus, whose victories
acquired him the sirname of Macedonianus, and Cornelius
Lupus, at that time <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Princeps Senatus</span></span>. Lucilius was equally
severe on contemporary and preceding authors; Ennius, Pacuvius,
and Attius, having been alternately satirized by him<a id="noteref_415" name="noteref_415" href="#note_415"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">415</span></span></a>.

so well from a player, whom he had ventured to censure, and
who took his revenge by exposing Lucilius on the stage. The
poet prosecuted the actor, and the cause was carried on with
much warmth on both sides before the Prætor, who finally
acquitted the player<a id="noteref_417" name="noteref_417" href="#note_417"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">417</span></span></a>.

The harsh and uncultivated spirit of the ancient Romans also

father, which should be reserved for one. Near the com<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page244">[pg 244]</span><a name="Pg244" id="Pg244" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>mencement of this book he represents an assembly of the gods

Horace, in the fifth satire of his first book, has, in imitation of
Lucilius, comically described a journey from Rome to Brundusium,
and like him has introduced a gladiatorial combat.
The fourth satire of Lucilius stigmatizes the luxury and vices
of the rich, and has been imitated by Persius in his third
book. Aulus Gellius informs us, that in part of his fifth satire
he exposed, with great wit and power of ridicule, those
literary affectations of using such words in one sentence as
terminate with a similar jingle, or consist of an equal number
of syllables. He has shown how childish such affectations
are, in that passage wherein he complains to a friend that he
had neglected to visit him while sick. In the ninth satire he
ridicules the blunders in orthography, committed by the transcribers
of MSS., and gives rules for greater accuracy. Of
the tenth book little remains; but it is said to have been the
perusal of it which first inflamed Persius with the rage of
writing satires. The eleventh seems to have consisted chiefly
of personal invectives against Quintus Opimius, Lucius Cotta,
and others of his contemporaries, whose vices, or rivalship
with his patron Scipio, exposed them to his enmity and
vengeance. The sixteenth was entitled <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Collyra</span></span>, having been
chiefly devoted to the celebration of the praises of Collyra,
the poet’s mistress<a id="noteref_420" name="noteref_420" href="#note_420"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">420</span></span></a>. Of many of the other books, as the
12th, 13th, 18th, 21st, and four following, so small fragments
remain, that it is impossible to conjecture the subject; for
although we may see the scope of insulated lines, their matter
may have been some incidental illustration, and not the principal
subject of the satire. Even in those books, of which
there are a greater number of fragments extant, they are so
disjoined that it is as difficult to put them legibly together as
the scattered leaves of the Sibyl; and the labour of Douza,
who has been the most successful in arranging the broken
lines, so as to make a connected sense, is by many considered
as but a conjectural and philological sport. Those few passages,
however, which are in any degree entire, show great
force of satire; as for example, the following account of the
life led by the Romans:—

If we possessed a larger portion of the writings of Lucilius,
I have no doubt it would be found that subsequent Latin
poets, particularly the satirists, have not only copied various
passages, but adopted the plan and subjects of many of his
satires. It has already been mentioned, that Horace’s journey
to Brundusium is imitated from that of Lucilius to Capua.
His severity recommended him to Persius and Juvenal, who
both mention him with respect. Persius, indeed, professes to
follow him, but Juvenal seems a closer imitator of his manner.

serviceable to philological learning. They would have
informed us also of many incidents of Roman history, and

ancient Roman manners, and genuine Roman originals, which
were painted from life, and at length became the model of
the inimitable satires of imperial Rome.

Besides satirizing the wicked, under which category he
probably classed all his enemies, Lucilius also employed his
pen in praise of the brave and virtuous. He wrote, as we
learn from Horace, a panegyric on Scipio Africanus, but
whether the elder or younger is not certain:—

Lucilius was also author of a comedy entitled <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Nummularia</span></span>,
of which only one line remains; but we are informed by Porphyrion,
the scholiast on Horace, that the plot turned on Pythias,
a female slave, tricking her master, Simo, out of a sum
of money, with which to portion his daughter.

Lucilius was followed in his satiric career by Sævius Nicanor,
the grammarian, who was the freedman of one Marcius,

We may range among the satires of this period, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Diræ</span></span>
of the grammarian, Valerius Cato, who, being despoiled of his
patrimony, especially his favourite villa at Tusculum, during
the civil wars of Marius and Sylla, in order to make way for
the soldiery, avenged himself, by writing poetical imprecations
on his lost property. This poem is sometimes inscribed
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page249">[pg 249]</span><a name="Pg249" id="Pg249" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Diræ in Battarum</span></span>, which is inaccurate, as it gives an idea
that Battarus is the name of the person who had got possession
of the villa, and on whom the imprecations were uttered.
There is not, however, a word of execration against any of
those who had obtained his lands, except in so far as he
curses the lands themselves, praying that they may become
barren—that they may be inundated with rain—blasted with
pestiferous breezes, and, in short, laid waste by every species
of agricultural calamity. Joseph Scaliger thinks that Battarus
was a river, and Nic. Heinsius that it was a hill. It seems
evident enough from the poem itself, that Battarus was some
well known satiric or invective bard, whom the author invokes,
in order to excite himself to reiterated imprecations<a id="noteref_427" name="noteref_427" href="#note_427"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">427</span></span></a>:—

is a lamentation for the loss of a mistress, called Lydia, of
whom the unfortunate poet had likewise been deprived. This,
however, has been regarded by others as a separate poem
from the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Diræ</span></span>. Cato was also author of a poem called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Diana</span></span>,

The stream of Roman poetry appears to have suffered a
temporary stagnation during the period that elapsed from the
destruction of Carthage, which fell in 607, till the death of
Sylla, in 674. Lucilius, with whose writings we have been
engaged, was the only poet who flourished in this long interval.
The satirical compositions which he introduced were
not very generally nor successfully imitated. The race of
dramatists had become almost extinct, and even the fondness
for regular comedy and tragedy had greatly diminished. This
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page250">[pg 250]</span><a name="Pg250" id="Pg250" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>was a pause, (though for a shorter period,) like that which
was made in modern Italy, from the death of Petrarch till the
rise of its bright constellation of poets, at the end of the 15th
century. But the taste for literature which had been excited,
and the luminous events which occurred, prevented either
nation from being again enveloped in darkness. The ancient
Romans could not be electrified by the fall of Carthage
as their descendants were by the capture of Constantinople.
But even the total subjugation of Greece, and extended dominion
in Asia, were slower, at least in their influence on the
efforts of poetry, than might have been anticipated from what
was experienced immediately after the conquest of Magna
Græcia. Any retrograde movement, however, was prevented
by the more close and frequent intercourse which was opened
with Greece. There, Athens and Rhodes were the chief
allies of the Roman republic. These states had renounced
their freedom, for the security which flattery and subservience
obtained for them; but while they ceased to be considerable
in power, they still continued pre eminent in learning. A
number of military officers and civil functionaries, whom their
respective employments carried to Greece—a number of citizens,
whom commercial speculations attracted to its towns,
became acquainted with and cherished Grecian literature.
That contempt which the ancient and severe republicans had
affected for its charms, gave place to the warmest enthusiasm.
The Roman youth were instructed by Greeks, or by Romans
who had studied in Greece. A literary tour in that country
was regarded as forming an essential part in the education
of a young patrician. Rhodes, Mitylene, and Athens, were
chiefly resorted to, as the purest fountains from which the inspiring
draughts of literature could be imbibed. This constant
intercourse led to a knowledge of the philosophy and finest
classical productions of Greece. It was thus that Lucretius
was enabled to embody in Roman verse the whole Epicurean
system, and Catullus to imitate or translate the lighter amatory
and epigrammatic compositions of the Greeks. Both these
poets flourished during the period on which we are now entering,
and which extended from the death of Sylla to the accession
of Augustus. The former of them,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
was the most remarkable of the Roman writers, as he united
the precision of the philosopher to the fire and fancy of the
poet; and, while he seems to have had no perfect model
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page251">[pg 251]</span><a name="Pg251" id="Pg251" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>among the Greeks, has left a production unrivalled, (perhaps
not to be rivalled,) by any of the same kind in later ages.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Of the life of Lucretius very little is known: He lived at a
period abounding with great political actors, and full of portentous
events—a period when every bosom was agitated with
terror or hope, and when it must have been the chief study of
a prudent man, especially if a votary of philosophy and the
Muses, to hide himself as much as possible amid the shades.
The year of his birth is uncertain. According to the chronicle
of Eusebius, he was born in 658, being thus nine years younger
than Cicero, and two or three younger than Cæsar. To judge
from his style, he might be supposed older than either: but
this, as appears from the example of Sallust, is no certain test,
as his archaisms may have arisen from the imitation of ancient
writers; and we know that he was a fond admirer of Ennius.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A taste for Greek philosophy had been excited at Rome for
a considerable time before this era, and Lucretius was sent,
with other young Romans of rank, to study at Athens. The
different schools of philosophy in that city seem, about this
period, to have been frequented according as they received a
temporary fashion from the comparative abilities of the professors
who presided in them. Cicero, for example, who had
attended the Epicurean school at Athens, and became himself
an Academic, intrusted his son to the care of Cratippus, a peripatetic
philosopher. After the death of its great founder, the
school of Epicurus had for some time declined in Greece: but
at the period when Lucretius was sent to Athens, it had again
revived under the patronage of L. Memmius, whose son was a
fellow-student of Lucretius; as were also Cicero, his brother
Quintus, Cassius, and Pomponius Atticus. At the time when
frequented by these illustrious youths, the Gardens of Epicurus
were superintended by Zeno and Phædrus, both of whom, but
particularly the latter, have been honoured with the panegyric
of Cicero. <span class="tei tei-q">“We formerly, when we were boys,”</span> says he, in
a letter to Caius Memmius, <span class="tei tei-q">“knew him as a profound philosopher,
and we still recollect him as a kind and worthy man,
ever solicitous for our improvement<a id="noteref_430" name="noteref_430" href="#note_430"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">430</span></span></a>.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
One of the dearest, perhaps the dearest friend of Lucretius,
was this Memmius, who had been his school-fellow, and whom,
it is supposed, he accompanied to Bithynia, when appointed to
the government of that province<a id="noteref_431" name="noteref_431" href="#note_431"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">431</span></span></a>. The poem <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De Rerum Natura</span></span>,
if not undertaken at the request of Memmius, was doubtless
much encouraged by him; and Lucretius, in a dedication
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page252">[pg 252]</span><a name="Pg252" id="Pg252" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>expressed in terms of manly and elegant courtesy, very different
from the servile adulation of some of his great successors,
tells him, that the much desired pleasure of his friendship, was
what enabled him to endure any toil or vigils—

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The life of the poet was short, but happily was sufficiently
prolonged to enable him to complete his poem, though, perhaps,
not to give some portions of it their last polish. According
to Eusebius, he died in the 44th year of his age, by
his own hands, in a paroxysm of insanity, produced by a philtre,
which Lucilia, his wife or mistress, had given him, with no
design of depriving him of life or reason, but to renew or increase
his passion. Others suppose that his mental alienation
proceeded from melancholy, on account of the calamities of his
country, and the exile of Memmius,—circumstances which
were calculated deeply to affect his mind<a id="noteref_432" name="noteref_432" href="#note_432"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">432</span></span></a>. There seems no
reason to doubt the melancholy fact, that he perished by his
own hand.

The poem of Lucretius, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De Rerum Natura</span></span>, which he composed
during the lucid intervals of his malady, is, as the name
imports, philosophic and didactic, in the strictest acceptation
of these terms. Poetry, I think, may chiefly be considered as
occupied in three ways.—1. As describing the passions of men,
with the circumstances which give birth to them.—2. As
painting images or scenery.—3. As communicating truth. Of
these classes of poetry, the most interesting is the first, in
which we follow the hero placed at short intervals in different
situations, calculated to excite various sympathies in our
heart, while our imagination is at the same time amused or
astonished by the singularity of the incidents which such situations
produce. Those poems, therefore, are the most attractive,
in which, as in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Odyssey</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Orlando</span></span>, knights or
warriors plough unknown seas, and wander in strange lands—where,
at every new horizon which opens, we look for countries
inhabited by giants, or monsters, or wizards of supernatural
powers—where, whether sailing on the deep, or
anchoring on the shore, the hero dreads—

Of all the three species above enumerated, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Philosophical</span></span>
poetry, which occupies the mind with minute portions of external
nature, is the least attractive. Mankind will always
prefer books which move to those which instruct—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ennui</span></span> being
more burdensome than ignorance. In philosophic poetry, our

Besides, as has been observed by Montesquieu, reason is
sufficiently chained, though we fetter her not with rhyme; and,
on the other hand, poetry loses much of its freedom and lightness,
if clogged with the bonds of reason. The great object
of poetry (according to a trite remark,) is to afford pleasure;
but philosophic poetry affords less pleasure than epic, descriptive,
or dramatic. The versifier of philosophic subjects is in
danger of producing a work neither interesting enough for
the admirers of sentiment and imagination, nor sufficiently
profound for philosophers. He will sometimes soar into regions
where many of his readers are unable to follow him, and,
at other times, he will lose the suffrage of a few, by interweaving
fictions amid the severe and simple truth.

It is the business of the philosopher to analyze the objects
of nature. He must pay least attention to those which chiefly
affect the sense and imagination, while he minutely considers
others, which, though less striking, are more useful for classification,
and the chief purposes he has in view. The poet, on
the other hand, avoiding dry and abstract definitions, rather
combines than analyzes, and dwells more on the sensible
phænomena of nature, than her mysterious and scientific
workings. Thus, what the botanist considers is the number of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">stamina</span></span>, and their situation in a flower, while the Muse describes
only its colours, and the influence of its odours—

But though philosophic poetry be, of all others, the most
unfavourable for the exertion of poetical genius, its degree
of beauty and interest will, in a great measure, depend on
what parts of his subject the poet selects, and on the extent
and number of digressions of which it admits. It is evident,
that the philosophic poet should pass over as lightly as may
be, all dry and recondite doctrines, and enlarge on the topics
most susceptible of poetical ornament. <span class="tei tei-q">“Le Tableau de la
Nature Physique,”</span> says Voltaire, <span class="tei tei-q">“est lui seule d’une richesse,
d’une varieté, d’une etendue à occuper des siécles d’étude;

With regard, again, to digressions, Racine, (le Fils) in speaking
of didactic poetry, says there are two sorts of episodes
which may be introduced into it, and which he terms episodes
of narrative and of style, (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De Recit et de Style</span></span>,) meaning by
the former the recital of the adventures of individuals, and by
the latter, general reflections suggested by the subject<a id="noteref_436" name="noteref_436" href="#note_436"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">436</span></span></a>.
Without some embellishment of this description, most philosophic
poems will correspond to Quintilian’s account of the
poem of Aratus on astronomy, <span class="tei tei-q">“Nulla varietas, nullus affectus,

already been said concerning the extreme interest excited by
the introduction of sentient beings, with all their perils around,
and all their passions within them, it follows, that where the
subject admits, episodes of the first class will best serve the
purposes of poetry, and if the poet choose such dry and abstruse
topics as cosmogony, or the generation of the world,
he ought to follow the example of Silenus<a id="noteref_438" name="noteref_438" href="#note_438"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">438</span></span></a>, by embellishing

It is, however, with the second class of episodes—with declamations
against luxury and vice—reflections on the beauty
of virtue—and the delights of rural retirement, that Lucretius
hath chiefly gemmed his verses.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The poem of Lucretius contains a full exposition of the
theological, physical, and moral system of Epicurus. It has
been remarked by an able writer, <span class="tei tei-q">“that all the religious systems
of the ancient Pagan world were naturally perishable,
from the quantity of false opinions, and vicious habits, and
ceremonies that were attached to them.”</span> He observes even
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page256">[pg 256]</span><a name="Pg256" id="Pg256" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of the barbarous Anglo Saxons, that, <span class="tei tei-q">“as the nation advanced
in its active intellect, it began to be dissatisfied with its mythology.
Many indications exist of this spreading alienation,
which prepared the northern mind for the reception of the
nobler truths of Christianity<a id="noteref_439" name="noteref_439" href="#note_439"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">439</span></span></a>.”</span> A secret incredulity of this
sort seems to have been long nourished in Greece, and appears
to have been imported into Rome with its philosophy and
literature. The more pure and simple religion of early Rome
was quickly corrupted, and the multitude of ideal and heterogeneous
beings which superstition introduced into the Roman
worship led to its total rejection<a id="noteref_440" name="noteref_440" href="#note_440"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">440</span></span></a>. This infidelity is very
obvious in the writings of Ennius, who translated Euhemerus’
work on the Deification of Human Spirits, while Plautus
dramatized the vices of the father of the gods and tutelary
deity of Rome. The doctrine of materialism was introduced
at Rome during the age of Scipio and Lælius<a id="noteref_441" name="noteref_441" href="#note_441"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">441</span></span></a>; and perhaps
no stronger proof of its rapid progress and prevalence can be
given, than that Cæsar, though a priest, and ultimately Pontifex
Maximus, boldly proclaimed in the senate, that death is
the end of all things, and that beyond it there is neither hope
nor joy. This state of the public mind was calculated to give
a fashion to the system of Epicurus<a id="noteref_442" name="noteref_442" href="#note_442"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">442</span></span></a>. According to this
distinguished philosopher, the chief good of man is pleasure,
of which the elements consist, in having a body free from
pain, and a mind tranquil and exempt from perturbation. Of
this tranquility there are, according to Epicurus, as expounded
by Lucretius, two chief enemies, superstition, or slavish fear
of the gods, and the dread of death<a id="noteref_443" name="noteref_443" href="#note_443"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">443</span></span></a>. In order to oppose
these two foes to happiness, he endeavours, in the first place,
to shew that the world was formed by a fortuitous concourse
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page257">[pg 257]</span><a name="Pg257" id="Pg257" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of atoms, and that the gods, who, according to the popular
theology, were constantly interposing, take no concern whatever
in human affairs. We do injustice to Epicurus when
we estimate his tenets by the refined and exalted ideas of a
philosophy purified by faith, without considering the superstitious
and polluted notions prevalent in his time. <span class="tei tei-q">“The
idea of Epicurus,”</span> (as is observed by Dr Drake,) <span class="tei tei-q">“that it is
the nature of gods to enjoy an immortality in the bosom of
perpetual peace, infinitely remote from all relation to this
globe, free from care, from sorrow, and from pain, supremely
happy in themselves, and neither rejoicing in the pleasures,
nor concerned for the evils of humanity—though perfectly
void of any rational foundation, yet possesses much moral
charm when compared with the popular religions of Greece
and Rome. The felicity of their deities consisted in the
vilest debauchery; nor was there a crime, however deep its
dye, that had not been committed and gloried in by some one
of their numerous objects of worship<a id="noteref_444" name="noteref_444" href="#note_444"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">444</span></span></a>.”</span> Never, also, could
the doctrine, that the gods take no concern in human affairs,
appear more plausible than in the age of Lucretius, when
the destiny of man seemed to be the sport of the caprice of
such a monster as Sylla.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
With respect to the other great leading tenet of Lucretius
and his master—the mortality of the soul, still greater injustice
is done to the philosopher and poet. It is affirmed, and
justly, by a great Apostle, that life and immortality have been
brought to light by the gospel; and yet an author who lived
before this dawn is reviled because he asserts, that the natural
arguments for the immortality of the soul, afforded by the
analogies of nature, or principle of moral retribution, are weak
and inconclusive! In fact, however, it is not by the truth of
the system or general philosophical views in a poem, (for
which no one consults it,) that its value is to be estimated;
since a poetical work may be highly moral on account of its
details, even when its systematic scope is erroneous or apparently
dangerous. Notwithstanding passages which seem to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page258">[pg 258]</span><a name="Pg258" id="Pg258" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>echo Spinosism, and almost to justify crime<a id="noteref_445" name="noteref_445" href="#note_445"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">445</span></span></a>, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Essay on
Man</span></span> is rightly considered as the most moral production of
our most moral poet. In like manner, where shall we find
exhortations more eloquent than those of Lucretius, against
ambition and cruelty, and luxury and lust,—against all the
dishonest pleasures of the body, and all the turbulent passions
of the mind.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In versifying the philosophical system of Epicurus, Lucretius
appears to have taken Empedocles as his model. All the
old Grecian bards of whom we have any account prior to Homer,
as Orpheus, Linus, and Musæus, are said to have written
poems on the driest and most difficult philosophical questions,
particularly the generation of the world. The ancients evidently
considered philosophical poetry as of the highest kind,
and its themes are invariably placed in the mouths of their
divinest songsters<a id="noteref_446" name="noteref_446" href="#note_446"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">446</span></span></a>. Whether Lucretius may have been
indebted to any such ancient poems, still extant in his age, or
to the subsequent productions of Palæphatus the Athenian,
Antiochus, or Eratosthenes, who, as Suidas informs us, wrote
poems on the structure of the world, it is impossible now to
determine; but he seems to have considerably availed himself
of the work of Empedocles. The poem of that sumptuous,
accomplished, and arrogant philosopher, entitled <span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-family: Gentium, 'New Athena Unicode', 'DejaVu Serif', 'Lucida Grande', 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Palatino Linotype', serif">Περι φυσεως</span></span>,
and inscribed to his pupil Pausanias, was chiefly illustrative
of the Pythagorean philosophy, in which he had been initiated.
Aristotle speaks on the subject of the merits of Empedocles
in a manner which does not seem to be perfectly
consistent<a id="noteref_447" name="noteref_447" href="#note_447"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">447</span></span></a>; but we know that his poem was sufficiently
celebrated to be publicly recited at the Olympic games, along
with the works of Homer. Only a few fragments of his writings
remain; from which, perhaps, it would be as unfair to
judge him, as to estimate Lucretius by extracts from the physical
portions of his poem. Those who have collected the
detached fragments of his production<a id="noteref_448" name="noteref_448" href="#note_448"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">448</span></span></a>, think that it had been
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page259">[pg 259]</span><a name="Pg259" id="Pg259" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>divided into three books; the first treating of the elements
and universe,—the second of animals and man,—the third of
the soul, as also of the nature and worship of the gods. His
philosophical system was different from that of Lucretius; but
he had discussed almost all the subjects on which the Roman
bard afterwards expatiated. In particular, Lucretius appears
to have derived from his predecessor his notion of the original
generation of man from the teeming earth,—the production,
at the beginning of the world, of a variety of defective
monsters, which were not allowed to multiply their kinds,—the
distribution of animals according to the prevalence of one
or other of the four elements over the rest in their composition,—the 
vicissitudes of matter between life and inanimate substance,—and
the leading doctrine, <span class="tei tei-q">“mortem nihil ad nos pertinere,”</span>
because absolute insensibility is the consequence of
dissolution<a id="noteref_449" name="noteref_449" href="#note_449"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">449</span></span></a>.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If Lucretius has in any degree benefited by the works of
Empedocles, he has in return been most lavish and eloquent
in his commendations. One of the most delightful features
in the character of the Latin poet is, the glow of admiration
with which he writes of his illustrious predecessors. His
eulogy of the Sicilian philosopher, which he has so happily
combined with that of the country which gave him birth,
affords a beautiful example of his manner of infusing into
everything a poetic sweetness, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Musæo contingens cuncta

In the first and second books, Lucretius chiefly expounds
the cosmogony, or physical part of his system—a system
which had been originally founded by Leucippus, a philosopher
of the Eleatic sect, and, from his time, had been
successively improved by Democritus and Epicurus. He
establishes in these books his two great principles,—that
nothing can be made from nothing, and that nothing can ever
be annihilated or return to nothing; and, that there is in the
universe a void or space, in which atoms interact. These
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page261">[pg 261]</span><a name="Pg261" id="Pg261" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>atoms he believes to be the original component parts of all

such corpuscles occasions, according to him, the whole difference

It cannot be denied, that in these two books particularly,

poem,) there are many barren tracts—many physiological,
meteorological, and geological details—which are at once
too incorrect for the philosophical, and too dry and abstract
for the poetical reader. It is wonderful, however, how Lucretius
contrives, by the beauty of his images, to give a picturesque
colouring and illustration to the most unpromising
topics. Near the beginning of his poem, for example, in
attempting to prove a very abstract proposition, he says,—

In spite, however, of the powers of Lucretius, it was impossible,
from the very nature of his subject, but that some portions
would prove altogether unsusceptible of poetical embellishment.
Yet it may be doubted, whether these intractable
passages, by the charm of contrast, do not add, like deserts to
Oases in their bosom, an additional deliciousness in proportion
to their own sterility. The lovely group above-mentioned
by Warton, are clothed with additional beauty and enchantment,
from starting, as it were, like Armida and her Nymphs,
from the mossy rind of a rugged tree. The philosophical
analysis, too, employed by Lucretius, impresses the mind with
the conviction, that the poet is a profound thinker, and adds
great force to his moral reflections. Above all, his fearlessness,
if I may say so, produces this powerful effect. Dryden,
in a well-known passage, where he has most happily characterized
the general manner of Lucretius, observes, <span class="tei tei-q">“If I am
not mistaken, the distinguishing character of Lucretius—I
mean, of his soul and genius—is a certain kind of noble pride,
and positive assertion of his own opinions. He is everywhere
confident of his own reason, and assuming an absolute command,
not only over his vulgar readers, but even his patron,
Memmius.... This is that particular dictatorship which is
exercised by Lucretius; who, though often in the wrong, yet
seems to deal <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">bona fide</span></span> with his reader, and tells him nothing
but what he thinks.... He seems to disdain all manner
of replies; and is so confident of his cause, that he is before-hand
with his antagonists, urging for them whatever he imagined
they could say, and leaving them, as he supposes,
without an objection for the future. All this, too, with so
much scorn and indignation, as if he were assured of the
triumph, and need only enter into the lists.”</span> Hence while,
in other writers, the eulogy of virtue seems in some sort to
partake of the nature of a sermon—to be a conventional
language, and words of course—we listen to Lucretius as to
one who will fearlessly speak out; who had shut his ears to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page263">[pg 263]</span><a name="Pg263" id="Pg263" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the murmurs of Acheron: and who, if he eulogizes Virtue,
extols her because her charms are real. How exquisite, for
example, and, at the same time, how powerful and convincing,
his delineation of the utter worthlessness of vanity and pomp,
contrasted with the pure and perfect delights of simple nature!

The word <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Præsertim</span></span>, in this beautiful passage, affords an
illustration of what has been remarked above, that the kind of
philosophical analysis employed by Lucretius gives great
force to his moral reflections. He seems, as it were, to be
weighing his words; and, which is the only solid foundation
of just confidence, to be cautious of asserting anything which
experience would not fully confirm. One thing very remarkable
in this great poet is, the admirable clearness and closeness
of his reasoning. He repeatedly values himself not a little on
the circumstance, that, with an intractable subject, and a
language not yet accommodated to philosophical discussions,
and scanty in terms of physical as well as metaphysical
science, he was able to give so much clearness to his argument<a id="noteref_451" name="noteref_451" href="#note_451"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">451</span></span></a>;
which object it is generally admitted he has accomplished,
with little or no sacrifice of pure Latinity<a id="noteref_452" name="noteref_452" href="#note_452"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">452</span></span></a>. As a
proof at once of the perspicuity and closeness of his reasoning,
and the fertility of his mind in inventing arguments, there
might be given his long discussion, in the third book, on the
materiality of the human soul, and its incapability of surviving
the ruin of the corporeal frame. Never were the arguments
for materialism marshalled with such skill—never were the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page264">[pg 264]</span><a name="Pg264" id="Pg264" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>diseases of the mind, and the decay of memory and understanding,
so pathetically urged, so eloquently expressed. The
following quotation contains a specimen of the lucid and
logical reasoning of this philosophic poet; and the two first
verses, perhaps, after all that has been written, comprehend
the whole that is metaphysically or physiologically known
upon the subject:

Lucretius having, by many arguments, endeavoured to
establish the mortality of the soul, proceeds to exhort against
a dread of death. The fear of that <span class="tei tei-q">“last tremendous blow,”</span>
appears to have harassed, and sometimes overwhelmed, the
minds of the Romans<a id="noteref_453" name="noteref_453" href="#note_453"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">453</span></span></a>. To them, life presented a scene
of high duties and honourable labours; and they contemplated,
in a long futurity, the distant completion of their
serious and lofty aims. They were not yet habituated to
regard life as a banquet or recreation, from which they were
cheerfully to rise, in due time, sated with the feast prepared
for them; nor had they been accustomed to associate death
with those softening ideas of indolence and slumber, with
which it was the design of Lucretius to connect it. He
accordingly represents it as a privation of all sense,—as undisturbed
by tumult or terror, by grief or pain,—as a tranquil
sleep, and an everlasting repose. How sublime is the following
passage, in which, to illustrate his argument, that the long
night of the grave can be no more painful than the eternity
before our birth, he introduces the war with Carthage; and
what a picture does it convey of the energy and might of the
combatants!

From this admirable passage till the close of the third book
there is an union of philosophy, of majesty, and pathos, which
hardly ever has been equalled. The incapacity of the highest
power and wisdom, as exhibited in so many instances, to
exempt from the common lot of man, the farewell which we
must bid to the sweetest domestic enjoyments, and the magnificent
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">prosopopœia</span></span> of Nature to her children, rebuking their
regrets, and the injustice of their complaints, are altogether
exceedingly solemn, and affecting, and sublime.

The two leading tenets of Epicurus concerning the formation
of the world and the mortality of the soul, are established
by Lucretius in the first three books. A great proportion of
the fourth book may be considered as episodical. Having
explained the nature of primordial atoms, and of the soul,
which is formed from the finest of them, he announces, that
there are certain images (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">rerum simulacra</span></span>,) or effluvia, which
are constantly thrown off from the surface of whatever exists.
On this hypothesis he accounts for all our external senses;
and he applies it also to the theory of dreams, in which whatever
images have amused the senses during day most readily
recur. Mankind being prone to love, of all the phantoms
which rush on our imagination during night, none return so
frequently as the forms of the fair. This leads Lucretius to
enlarge on the mischievous effects of illicit love; and nothing
can be finer than the various moral considerations which he
enforces, to warn us against the snares of guilty passion. It
must, however, be confessed, that his description of what he
seems to consider as the physical evils and imperfect fruition
of sensual love, forms the most glowing picture ever presented
of its delights. But he has atoned for his violation of decorum,
by a few beautiful lines on connubial happiness at the
conclusion of the book:

The principal subject of the fifth book—a composition
unrivalled in energy and richness of language, in full and
genuine sublimity—is the origin and laws of the visible world,
with those of its inhabitants. The poet presents us with a
grand picture of Chaos, and the most magnificent account of
the creation that ever flowed from human pen. In his representation
of primeval life and manners, he exhibits the discomfort
of this early stage of society by a single passage of
most wild and powerful imagery,—in which he describes a
savage, in the early ages of the world, when men were yet
contending with beasts for possession of the earth, flying
through the woods, with loud shrieks, in a stormy night, from
the pursuit of some ravenous animal, which had invaded
the cavern where he sought a temporary shelter and repose:

One is naturally led to compare the whole of Lucretius’
description of primeval society, and the origin of man, with
Ovid’s <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Four Ages of the World</span></span>, which commence his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Metamorphoses</span></span>,
and which, philosophically considered, certainly
exhibit the most wonderful of all metamorphoses. In his
sketch of the Golden Age, he has selected the favourable circumstances
alluded to by Lucretius—exemption from war and
sea voyages, and spontaneous production of fruits by the earth.
There is also a beautiful view of early life and manners in one
of the elegies of Tibullus<a id="noteref_454" name="noteref_454" href="#note_454"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">454</span></span></a>; and Thomson, in his picture of
what he calls the <span class="tei tei-q">“prime of days,”</span> has combined the descriptions
of Ovid and the elegiac bard. Most of the poets, however,
who have painted the Golden Age, and Ovid in particular,
have represented mankind as growing more vicious and
unhappy with advance of time—Lucretius, more philosophically,
as constantly improving. He has fixed on connubial
love as the first great softener of the human breast; and neither
Thomson nor Milton has described with more tenderness,
truth, and purity, the joys of domestic union. He follows the
progressive improvement of mankind occasioned by their
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page267">[pg 267]</span><a name="Pg267" id="Pg267" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>subjection to the bonds of civil society and government; and

fine arts, particularly music, in the course of which many
impressive descriptions occur, and many delicious scenes are

In consequence of their ignorance and superstitions, the
Roman people were rendered perpetual slaves of the most
idle and unfounded terrors. In order to counteract these
popular prejudices, and to heal the constant disquietudes that
accompanied them, Lucretius proceeds, in the sixth book, to
account for a variety of extraordinary phænomena both in the
heavens and on the earth, which, at first view, seemed to deviate
from the usual laws of nature:—

Having discussed the various theories formed to account for
electricity, water-spouts, hurricanes, the rainbow, and volcanoes,
he lastly considers the origin of pestilential and endemic
disorders. This introduces the celebrated account of the
plague, which ravaged Athens during the Peloponnesian war,
with which Lucretius concludes this book, and his magnificent
poem. <span class="tei tei-q">“In this narrative,”</span> says a late translator of Lucretius,
<span class="tei tei-q">“the true genius of poetry is perhaps more powerfully and
triumphantly exhibited than in any other poem that was ever
written. Lucretius has ventured upon one of the most uncouth
and repressing subjects to the muses that can possibly
be brought forward—the history and symptoms of a disease,
and this disease accompanied with circumstances naturally the
most nauseating and indelicate. It was a subject altogether
new to numerical composition; and he had to strive with all
the pedantry of technical terms, and all the abstruseness of a
science in which he does not appear to have been professionally
initiated. He strove, however, and he conquered. In
language the most captivating and nervous, and with ideas
the most precise and appropriate, he has given us the entire
history of this tremendous pestilence. There is not, perhaps,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page268">[pg 268]</span><a name="Pg268" id="Pg268" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>a symptom omitted, yet there is not a verse with which the
most scrupulous can be offended. The description of the
symptoms, and also the various circumstances of horror and
distress attending this dreadful scourge, have been derived
from Thucydides, who furnished the facts with great accuracy,
having been himself a spectator and a sufferer under this
calamity. His narrative is esteemed an elaborate and complete
performance; and to the faithful yet elegant detail of
the Greek historian, the Roman bard has added all that was

In the whole history of Roman taste and criticism, nothing
appears to us so extraordinary as the slight mention that is
made of Lucretius by succeeding Latin authors; and, when
mentioned, the coldness with which he is spoken of by all
Roman critics and poets, with the exception of Ovid. Perhaps
the spirit of free-thinking which pervaded his writings,
rendered it unsuitable or unsafe to extol even his poetical
talents. There was a time, when, in this country, it was
thought scarcely decorous or becoming to express high admiration
of the genius of Rousseau or Voltaire.

The doctrines of Lucretius, particularly that which impugns
the superintending care of Providence, were first formally
opposed by the Stoic Manilius in his Astronomic poem.
In modern times, his whole philosophical system has been
refuted in the long and elaborate poem of the Cardinal Polignac,
entitled, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Anti-Lucretius, sive de Deo et Natura</span></span>. This
enormous work, though incomplete, consists of nine books,
of about 1300 lines each, and the whole is addressed to Quintius,
an atheist, who corresponds to the Lorenzo of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Night 
Thoughts</span></span>. Descartes is the Epicurus of the poem, and the
subject of many heavy panegyrics. In the philosophical part
of his subject, the Cardinal has sometimes refuted, at too
great length, propositions which are manifestly absurd—at
others, he has impugned demonstrated truths—and the moral
system of Lucretius he throughout has grossly misunderstood.
But he has rendered ample justice to his poetical merit; and,
in giving a compendium of the subject of his great antagonist’s
poem, he has caught some share of the poetical spirit
with which his predecessor was inspired:—

Entertaining this just admiration of his opponent, the Cardinal
has been studious, while refuting his principles, to imitate
as closely as possible the poetic style of Lucretius; and,
accordingly, we find many noble and beautiful passages interspersed
amid the dry discussions of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Anti-Lucretius</span></span>. In
the first book, there is an elegant comparison, something like
that by Wolsey in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Henry VIII.</span></span>, of a man who had wantoned
in the sunshine of prosperity, and was unprepared for the
storms of adversity, to the tender buds of the fruit-tree blighted
by the north-wind. The whole poem, indeed, is full of
many beautiful and appropriate similes. I have not room to
transcribe them, but may refer the reader to those in the first
book, of a sick man turning to every side for rest, to a traveller
following an <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ignis fatuus</span></span>; in the second, motes dancing
in the sun-beam to the atoms of Epicurus floating in the
immensity of space; in the third, the whole philosophy of
Epicurus to the infinite variety of splendid but fallacious
appearances produced by the shifting of scenery in our theatres,
(line 90,) and the identity of matter amid the various
shapes it assumes, to the transformations of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Proteus</span></span>. The
fourth book commences with a beautiful image of a traveller
on a steep, looking back on his journey; immediately followed
by a fine picture of the unhallowed triumph of Epicurus,
and Religion weeping during the festival of youths to his
honour. In the same book, there is a noble description of
the river Anio, (line 1459,) and a comparison of the rising of
sap in trees during spring to a fountain playing and falling
back on itself (780–845). We have in the fifth book a beautiful
argument, that the soul is not to be thought material,
because affected by the body, illustrated by musical instruments
(745). In the sixth book there occurs a charming
description of the sensitive plant; and, finally, of a bird singing
to his mate, to solace her while brooding over her
young:—

It is a philosophy founded on the most sublime calculations; and
it is in other lines and numbers than those of poetry, that the
book of nature must now be written. If we attempt to express
arithmetical or algebraical figures in verse, circumlocution is
always required; more frequently they cannot be expressed at
all; and if they could, the lines would have no advantage over
prose: nay, would have considerable disadvantage, from obscurity
and prolixity. All this is fully confirmed by an examination
of the writings of those who have attempted to embellish
the sublime system of Newton with the charms of poetry.
If we look, for example, into the poem of Boscovich on

With Lucretius and his subject it was totally the reverse.
From the incorrectness of his philosophical views, or rather
those of his age, much of his labour has been employed, so to
speak, in embodying straws in amber. Yet, with all its defects,
this ancient philosophy, if it deserve the name, had the advantage,
that its indefinite nature rendered it highly susceptible
of an embellishment, which can never be bestowed on a more
precise and accurate system. Hence, perhaps, it may be
safely foretold, that the philosophical poem of Lucretius will
remain unrivalled; and also, that the prediction of Ovid concerning
it will be verified—

In every part of our survey of Latin Literature, we have
had occasion to remark the imitative spirit of Roman poetry,
and the constant analogy and resemblance of all the productions
of the Latian muse to some Greek original. None of
his poetical predecessors was more versed in Greek literature
than Catullus; and his extensive knowledge of its beauties
procured for him the appellation of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Doctus</span></span><a id="noteref_458" name="noteref_458" href="#note_458"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">458</span></span></a>. He translated
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page272">[pg 272]</span><a name="Pg272" id="Pg272" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>many of the shorter and more delicate pieces of the Greeks;
an attempt which hitherto had been thought impossible,
though the broad humour of their comedies, the vehement
pathos of their tragedies, and the romantic interest of the
Odyssey, had stood the transformation. His stay in Bithynia,
though little advantageous to his fortune, rendered him better
acquainted than he might otherwise have been with the
productions of Greece, and he was therefore, in a great
degree, indebted to this expedition (on which he always
appears to have looked back with mortification and disappointment)
for those felicitous turns of expression, that grace,
simplicity, and purity, which are the characteristics of his
poems, and of which hitherto Greece alone had afforded
models. Indeed, in all his verses, whether elegiac or heroic,
we perceive his imitation of the Greeks, and it must be
admitted that he has drawn from them his choicest stores.
His Hellenisms are frequent—his images, similes, metaphors,
and addresses to himself, are all Greek; and even in the
versification of his odes we see visible traces of their origin.
Nevertheless, he was the founder of a new school of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Latin</span></span>
poetry; and as he was the first who used such variety of
measures, and perhaps himself invented some<a id="noteref_459" name="noteref_459" href="#note_459"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">459</span></span></a>, he was amply
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page273">[pg 273]</span><a name="Pg273" id="Pg273" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>entitled to call the poetical volume which he presented to
Cornelius Nepos, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lepidum Novum Libellum</span></span>. The beautiful
expressions, too, and idioms of the Greek language, which he
has so carefully selected, are woven with such art into the
texture of his composition, and so aptly figure the impassioned
ideas of his amorous muse, that they have all the fresh and
untarnished hues of originality.

The precise period, as well as place, of the birth of Catullus,
is a topic of debate and uncertainty. According to the

other authorities, in 667<a id="noteref_464" name="noteref_464" href="#note_464"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">464</span></span></a> or 668. In consequence of an invitation
from Manlius Torquatus, one of the noblest patricians
of the state, he proceeded in early youth to Rome, where he
appears to have kept but indifferent company, at least in point
of moral character. He impaired his fortune so much by
extravagance, that he had no one, as he complains,

This, however, must partly have been written in jest, as his
finances were always sufficient to allow him to keep up a
delicious villa, on the peninsula of Sirmio, and an expensive
residence at Tibur. With a view of improving his pecuniary
circumstances, he adopted the usual Roman mode of re-establishing
a diminished fortune, and accompanied Caius Memmius,
the celebrated patron of Lucretius, to Bithynia, when
he was appointed Prætor of that province. His situation,
however, was but little meliorated by this expedition, and,
in the course of it, he lost a beloved brother, who was
along with him, and whose death he has lamented in verses
never surpassed in delicacy or pathos. He came back to
Rome with a shattered constitution, and a lacerated heart.
From the period of his return to Italy till his decease, his time
appears to have been chiefly occupied with the prosecution
of licentious amours, in the capital or among the solitudes of
Sirmio. The Eusebian Chronicle places his death in 696,
and some writers fix it in 705. It is evident, however, that
he must have survived at least till 708, as Cicero, in his Letters,
talks of his verses against Cæsar and Mamurra as newly
written, and first seen by Cæsar in that year<a id="noteref_465" name="noteref_465" href="#note_465"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">465</span></span></a>. The distracted
and unhappy state of his country, and his disgust at the treatment
which he had received from Memmius, were perhaps
sufficient excuse for shunning political employments<a id="noteref_466" name="noteref_466" href="#note_466"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">466</span></span></a>; but
when we consider his taste and genius, we cannot help regretting
that he was merely an idler, and a debauchee. He loved
Clodia, (supposed to have been the sister of the infamous
Clodius,) a beautiful but shameless woman, whom he has
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page275">[pg 275]</span><a name="Pg275" id="Pg275" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>celebrated under the name of Lesbia<a id="noteref_467" name="noteref_467" href="#note_467"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">467</span></span></a>, as comparing her to
the Lesbian Sappho, her prototype in total abandonment to
guilty love. He also numbered among his mistresses, Hypsithilla
and Aufilena, ladies of Verona. Among his friends, he
ranked not only most men of pleasure and fashion in Rome,
but many of her eminent literary and political characters, as
Cornelius Nepos, Cicero, and Asinius Pollio. His enmities
seem to have been as numerous as his loves or friendships,
and competition in poetry, or rivalship in gallantry, appears
always to have been a sufficient cause for his dislike; and
where an antipathy was once conceived, he was unable to put
any restraint on the expression of his hostile feelings. His
poems are chiefly employed in the indulgence and commemoration
of these various passions. They are now given to us
without any order or attempt at arrangement: They were
distributed, indeed, by Petrus Crinitus, into three classes,
lyric, elegiac, and epigrammatic,—a division which has been
adopted in a few of the earlier editions; but there is no such
separation in the best MSS., nor is it probable that they were
originally thus classed by the author, as he calls his book
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Libellum Singularem</span></span>; and they cannot now be conveniently
reduced under these heads, since several poems, as the nuptials
of Peleus and Thetis, are written in hexameter measure. To
others, which may be termed occasional poems expressing to
his friends a simple idea, or relating the occurrences of the
day, in iambic or phalangian verse, it would be difficult to
assign any place in a systematic arrangement. Under what
class, for instance, could we bring the poem giving a detail
of his visit to the house of the courtezan, and the conversation
which passed there concerning Bithynia? The order, therefore,
in which the poems have been arbitrarily placed by the
latest editors and commentators, however immethodical, is the
only one which can be followed, in giving an account of the
miscellaneous productions of Catullus.

This poem on the death of Lesbia’s sparrow has suggested
many similar productions. Ovid’s elegy, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">In Mortem Psittaci</span></span><a id="noteref_474" name="noteref_474" href="#note_474"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">474</span></span></a>,
where he extols and laments the favourite parrot of his mistress,
Corinna, is a production of the same description; but it
has not so much delicacy, lightness, and felicity of expression.
It differs from it too, by directing the attention chiefly to the
parrot, whereas Catullus fixes it more on the lady, who had
been deprived of her favourite. Statius also has a poem on
the death of a parrot, entitled <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Psittacus Melioris</span></span><a id="noteref_475" name="noteref_475" href="#note_475"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">475</span></span></a>; and Lotichius,
a celebrated Latin poet, who flourished in Germany
about the middle of the 16th century, has, in his elegies, a
similar production on the death of a dolphin<a id="noteref_476" name="noteref_476" href="#note_476"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">476</span></span></a>. Naugerius, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">In

It has been imitated closely, and with application to a sparrow,
by Corrozet, Durant, and Monnoye, French poets of the 16th
century—by Gacon and Richer, in the beginning, and R. de
Juvigny, in the end, of the 18th century. In all these imitations,
the idea of a departure to regions of darkness, whence
no one returns, is faithfully preserved. Most of them are
written with much grace and elegance; and this, indeed, is a
sort of poetry in which the French remarkably excel.

4. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dedicatio Phaseli</span></span>. This is the consecration to Castor
and Pollux, of the vessel which brought the poet safe from
Bithynia to the shores of Italy. By a figure, daring even in
verse, he represents the ship as extolling its high services, and
claiming its well-earned dedication to Castor and Pollux, gods
propitious to mariners. From this poem we may trace the
progress of Catullus’s voyage: It would appear that he had
embarked from Pontus, and having coasted Thrace, sailed
through the Archipelago, and then into the Adriatic, whence
the vessel had been brought probably up the course of the Po,
and one of its branches, to the vicinity of Sirmio.

This sentiment, representing either the pleasure of conviviality,
or delights of love, (and much more so as when here
united,) in contrast with the gloom of death, possesses something
exquisitely tender and affecting. The picture of joy,
with Death in the distance, inspires a feeling of pensive morality,
adding a charm to the gayest scenes of life, as the
transientness of the rose enhances our sense of its beauty and
fragrance; and as the cloud, which throws a shade over the
horizon, sometimes softens and mellows the prospect. This
opposition of images succeeds even in painting; and the
Arcadian landscape of Poussin, representing the rural festivity
of swains, would lose much of its charm if it wanted the
monument and inscription. An example had been set of such
contrasted ideas in many epigrams of the Greeks, and also in
the Odes of Anacreon, who constantly excites himself and
fellow-passengers to unrestrained enjoyment at every stage,
by recalling to remembrance the irresistible speed with which
they are hurried to the conclusion of their journey—

On his own part, he promises only a hearty welcome, and the

invective.

The thirteen following poems are chiefly occupied with
vehement and indelicate abuse of those friends of the poet,
Furius and Aurelius, who were men of some quality and distinction,
but had wasted their fortunes by extravagance and
debauchery. In a former ode, we have seen him confident
that they would readily accompany him to the wildest or remotest
quarters of the globe: But he had subsequently quarrelled
with them, partly because they had stigmatized his
verses as soft and effeminate; and, in revenge for this affront,
he upbraids them with their poverty and vices. Of these
thirteen poems, the last, addressed to Furius, is a striking picture
of the sheltered situation of a villa. In the common
editions, the description refers to the villa of Catullus himself,
but Muretus thinks, it was rather meant to be applied to that
of Furius:

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
29. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">In Cæsarem</span></span>. Julius Cæsar, while yet but the general
of the Roman republic, had been accustomed, during his stay
in the north of Italy, to lodge at the house of the father of
Catullus in Verona. Notwithstanding the intimacy which in
consequence subsisted between Cæsar and his father, Catullus
lampooned the former on more than one occasion. In the
present epigram, he pours on him an unmeasured abuse, chiefly
for having bestowed the plunder of Britain and Gaul on his
favourite, the infamous Mamurra, who appropriated the public
money, and the spoils of whole nations, to support his boundless
extravagance. There is a story which has become very
common on the authority of Suetonius, that Cæsar invited
Catullus to supper on the day on which he first read some
satirical verses of the poet against himself and Mamurra, and
that he continued to lodge with his father as before<a id="noteref_481" name="noteref_481" href="#note_481"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">481</span></span></a>. It
appears that on one occasion, when some scurrilous verses by
Catullus were shown to him, he supped with Cicero at his
villa near Puteoli. On the 19th, he staid at the house of
Philippus till one in the afternoon, but saw nobody; he then
walked on the shore across to Cicero’s villa—bathed after two
o’clock, and heard the verses on Mamurra read, at which he
never changed countenance<a id="noteref_482" name="noteref_482" href="#note_482"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">482</span></span></a>. Now, this was in the year 708,
after the civil war had been ended, by the defeat and death
of the younger Pompey in Spain. It is most likely that this
29th epigram was the one which was read to him at Cicero’s
villa; and the 57th epigram, also directed against Cæsar and
Mamurra, is probably that concerning which the above anecdote
is related by Suetonius. Though it stands last of the
two in the works of Catullus, it was evidently written before
the 29th. He talks in it of Cæsar and Mamurra, as of persons
who were still on a footing of equality—in the other, he speaks
of their dividing the spoils of the provinces, Gaul, Britain,
Pontus, and Spain. The coolness and indifference which
Cæsar showed with regard to the first epigram written against
him, and the forgiveness he extended to its author, encouraged
Cicero, who was a gossip and newsmonger, or those who
attended him, to read to him another of the same description
while bathing at the Puteolan Villa.

31. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ad Sirmionem Peninsulam</span></span>. This heart-soothing invocation,
which is perhaps the most pleasing of all the productions

villa of our poet was situated. Sirmio was a peninsular
promontory, of about two miles circumference, projecting
into the Benacus, now the Lago di Garda—a lake celebrated
by Virgil as one of the noblest ornaments of Italy, and the
praises of which have been loudly re-echoed by the modern
Latin poets of that country, particularly by Fracastoro, who
dwelt in its vicinity, and who, while lamenting the untimely
death of his poetical friend, Marc Antonio del Torri, beautifully
represents the shade of Catullus, as still nightly wandering
amidst these favourite scenes—

Vestiges of the magnificent house supposed to have belonged
to Catullus, are yet shown on this peninsula. Its ruins, which
lie near the borders of the lake, still give the idea of an
extensive palace. There are even now, as we are informed
by travellers<a id="noteref_484" name="noteref_484" href="#note_484"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">484</span></span></a>, sufficient remains of mason-work, pilasters,
vaults, walls, and subterraneous passages, to assist the imagination
in representing to itself what the building was when
entire, at least in point of extent and situation. The length
of the whole construction, from north to south, is about 700
feet, and the breadth upwards of 300. The ground on which
it stood does not appear to have been level, and the fall to
the west was supplied by rows of vaults, placed on each other,
the top of which formed a terrace. On the east, the structure
had been raised on those steep and solid rocks which lined
the shore; on the front, which was to the north, and commanded
a magnificent view of the lake, an immense portico
seems to have projected from the building: under the ruins,
there are a number of subterraneous vaults, one of which ran
through the middle of the edifice, and along its whole length<a id="noteref_485" name="noteref_485" href="#note_485"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">485</span></span></a>.

The peninsula on which the villa of Catullus was situated,
is not surpassed in beauty or fertility by any spot in Italy.

so narrow is the bank that unites it to the mainland. The
promontory spreads behind the town, and rises into a hill
entirely covered with olives. Catullus,”</span> he continues, <span class="tei tei-q">“undoubtedly
inhabited this spot, and certainly he could not have
chosen a more delightful retreat. In the centre of a magni<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page288">[pg 288]</span><a name="Pg288" id="Pg288" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>ficent lake, surrounded with scenery of the greatest variety
and majesty, secluded from the world, yet beholding from
his garden the villas of his Veronese friends, he might have
enjoyed alternately the pleasures of retirement, and society;
and daily, without the sacrifice of his connexions, which
Horace seemed inclined to make in a moment of despondency,
he might have contemplated the grandeur and agitation of
the ocean, without its terrors and immensity. Besides, the
soil is fertile, and its surface varied; sometimes shelving in a
gentle declivity, at other times breaking in craggy magnificence,
and thus furnishing every requisite for delightful walks
and luxurious baths; while the views vary at every step, presenting
rich coasts or barren mountains, sometimes confined
to the cultivated scenes of the neighbouring shore, and at
other times bewildered and lost in the windings of the lake,
or in the recesses of the Alps. In short, more convenience
and more beauty are seldom united<a id="noteref_487" name="noteref_487" href="#note_487"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">487</span></span></a>.”</span> No wonder, then, that
Catullus, jaded and disappointed by his expedition to Bithynia,
should, on his return, have exclaimed with transport, that the
spot was not to be matched in the wide range of the world
of waters; or that he should have unloaded his mind of its
cares, in language so perfect, yet simple, that it could only
have flowed from a real and exquisite feeling. No poem in
the Latin language expresses tender feelings more tenderly,
and home feelings more naturally, than the Invocation to
Sirmio, in which the verses soothe and refresh us somewhat

These lines show that the most refined and tender feelings
were as familiar to the bosom of Catullus as the grossest.
Nothing can be more delicate than his description of the
emotions of one, who, after many wanderings and vicissitudes
of fortune, returns to his home, and to the scenes beloved in
youth or infancy: Nothing can be more beautiful than his
invocation to the peninsula—his fond request that the delightful
promontory, and the waters by which it was surrounded,
should join in welcoming him home; and, above all, his heartfelt
expression of delight at the prospect of again reclining
on his accustomed couch.

that tone of tenderness which pervades the preceding lines

happened in some other cases, that a verse had been subjoined
to this which properly belonged to a different ode, where
mirth, and not tenderness, prevailed.

The modern Latin poets of Italy frequently apostrophize
their favourite villas, in imitation of the address to Sirmio.
Flaminius, in a poem, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ad Agellum suum</span></span>, has described his
attachment to his farm and home, and the first lines of it rival
the tender and pleasing invocation of Catullus. Some of the

One of the most pleasing features in the works of the modern
Latin poets of Italy, is the descriptions of their villas, their
regret at leaving them, or their invitations to friends to come
and witness their happiness. Hence Fracastoro’s villa, in the
vicinity of Verona, Ambra, and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pulcherrima Mergellina</span></span>, are
now almost esteemed classic spots, like Tusculum or Tibur.

The invocation to the peninsula of Sirmio was evidently
written soon after the return of Catullus from Bithynia; and
his next poem worth noticing is a similar address to his villa
near Tibur. The thought, however, in this poem, is very
forced and poor. Catullus having been invited by his friend
Sextius, according to a common custom at Rome, to be one
of a party assembled at his house for the purpose of hearing
an oration composed by their host, had contracted such a
cold from its frigidity, that he was obliged to leave Rome,
and retire to this seat, in order to recover from its effects.
For his speedy restoration to health, he now gives thanks to
his salubrious villa. This residence was situated on the confines
of the ancient Latian and Sabine <a name="corr290" id="corr290" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">territories</span>, and the villas
there, as we learn from this ode, were sometimes called Tiburtine,
from the town of Tibur, and sometimes Sabine, from
the district where they lay; but the former appellation, it
seems, was greatly preferred by Catullus. As long as the
odes of Horace survive, the

will be remembered as forming one of the most delightful
retreats in Italy, and one which was so agreeable to its poet,
that he wished that of all others it might be the shelter and
refuge of his old age. From the present aspect of Tivoli, the
charm of the villas at the ancient Tibur may be still appreciated.
<span class="tei tei-q">“We ascended,”</span> says Eustace, <span class="tei tei-q">“the high hill on
which Tivoli stands, passing through groves of olives, till we
reached the summit. This town, the Tibur of the ancients,
stands in a delightful situation, sheltered by Monte Catillo,
and a semicircular range of Sabine mountains, and commanding,
on the other side, an extensive view over the Campagna,
bounded by the sea, Rome, Mount Soracte, and the pyramidal
hills of Monticelli and Monte Rotondo, the ancient
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page291">[pg 291]</span><a name="Pg291" id="Pg291" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Eretum. But the pride and ornament of Tivoli are still, as
anciently, the falls and the windings of the Anio, now Teverone.
This river having meandered from its source through
the vales of Sabina, glides gently through Tivoli, till, coming
to the brink of a rock, it precipitates itself in one mass down
the steep, and then boiling for an instant in its narrow channel,
rushes headlong through a chasm in the rock into the
caverns below.* * * To enjoy the scenery to advantage, the
traveller must cross the bridge, and follow the road which
runs at the foot of the classic Monte Catillo, and winds along
the banks of the Anio. As he advances he will have on his
left the steep banks covered with trees, shrubs, and gardens,
and on his right the bold but varying swells of the hills
shaded with groves of olives. These sunny declivities were
anciently interspersed with splendid villas, the favourite
abodes of the most luxurious and refined Romans. They are
now replaced by two solitary convents, but their site, often
conjectural or traditionary, is sometimes marked by scanty
<a name="corr291" id="corr291" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">vestiges</span> of ruins, and now and then by the more probable
resemblance of a name<a id="noteref_488" name="noteref_488" href="#note_488"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">488</span></span></a>.”</span> Eustace does not particularly mention
the farm or villa of Catullus. In the travels, however,
which pass under the name of M. Blainville, written in the
beginning of last century, we are informed, that a monastery
of the religious order of Mount Olivet was then established
on the spot where formerly stood the Tiburtine villa of Catullus<a id="noteref_489" name="noteref_489" href="#note_489"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">489</span></span></a>.
M. de Castellan fixes on the same spot, on account
of its situation between the Sabine and Tiburtine territory.
<span class="tei tei-q">“D’ailleurs,”</span> continues he, <span class="tei tei-q">“il n’est pas d’endroit plus retiré,
mieux garanti des vents, que cet angle rentrant de la vallée,
entouré de tous côtes par de hautes montagnes; ce qui est
encore un des caracteres du local choisi par notre poëte, qui
pretendoit y être à l’abri de tout autre vent que de celui qui
l’expose à la vengeance de sa maitresse<a id="noteref_490" name="noteref_490" href="#note_490"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">490</span></span></a>.”</span> It would appear
from Forsyth’s Travels, that a spot is still fixed on as the site
of the residence of Catullus. <span class="tei tei-q">“The villa of Catullus,”</span> he
says, <span class="tei tei-q">“is easily ascertained by his own minute description of
the place, by excavated marbles, and by the popular name of
Truglia.”</span> This spot, which is close to the church of St Angelo
in Piavola, is on the opposite side of the Anio from
Tibur, about a mile north from that town, and on the north
side of Monte Catillo, or what might be called the back of
that hill, in reference to the situation of Tibur. The Anio
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page292">[pg 292]</span><a name="Pg292" id="Pg292" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>divides the ancient Latian from the Sabine territory, and the
villa of Catullus was on the Sabine side of the river, but was
called Tiburtine from the vicinity of Tibur<a id="noteref_491" name="noteref_491" href="#note_491"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">491</span></span></a>.

The Romans, and particularly the Roman poets, as if the
rustic spirit of their Italian ancestry was not altogether banished
by the buildings of Rome, appear to have had a genuine
and exquisite relish for the delights of the country. This
feeling was not inspired by fondness for field-sports, since, although
habituated to violent exercises, the chase never was a
favourite amusement among the Romans, and they preferred
seeing wild animals baited in the amphitheatre, to hunting
them down in their native forests. The country then was not
relished as we are apt to enjoy it, for the sake of exercise or
rural pastimes, but solely for its amenity and repose, and the
mental tranquillity which it diffused. With them it seems to
have been truely,

Love of the country among the Romans thus became conjoined
with the idea of a life of pastoral tranquillity and retirement,—a
life of friendship, liberty, and repose,—free from labour
and care, and all turbulent passions. Scenes of this kind
delight and interest us supremely, whether they be painted
as what is desired or what is enjoyed. We feel how natural
it is for a mind with a certain disposition to relaxation
and indolence, when fatigued with the bustle of life, to long
for security and quiet, and for those sequestered scenes in which
they can be most exquisitely enjoyed. There is much less of
this in the writings of the Greeks, who were originally a sea-faring
and piratical, and not, like the Italians, a pastoral people.
It is thus that, even in their highest state of refinement,
the manners and feelings of nations bear some affinity to their
original rudeness, though that rudeness itself has been imperceptibly
converted into a source of elegance and ornament.

lyric production of Catullus which occurs, and there are only
three other poems of a similar class. In Greece, the public
games afforded a noble occasion for the display of lyric poetry,
and the sensibility of the Greeks fitted them to follow its highest
flights. But it was not so among the Romans. They had
no solemn festivals of assembled states: Their active and ambitious
life deadened them to the emotions which lyric poetry
should excite; and the gods, whose praises form the noblest
themes of the Æolian lyre, were with them rather the creatures
of state policy, than of feeling or imagination.

all the editions of Catullus, containing a moral reflection,

This stanza is so foreign from the spirit of high excitation in
which the preceding part of the ode is written, that Maffei
suspected it had belonged to some other poem of Catullus;
and Handius, in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Observationes Criticæ</span></span>, conjectures that
the fourth stanza, which Catullus translated from the original
Greek, having been lost, and a chasm being thus left, some
idle librarian or scholiast of the middle ages had interpolated
these four lines of misplaced morality, that no gap might appear
in his manuscript<a id="noteref_492" name="noteref_492" href="#note_492"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">492</span></span></a>. It is not impossible, however, that

Many amatory poets have tried to imitate this celebrated

resemblance to that of Boileau, is inserted in the delightful
chapter of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Voyage du Jeune Anacharsis</span></span>, which treats of
Lesbos and Sappho. Philips, it is well known, attempted a
version of the lyric stanzas of Sappho, which was first printed
with vast commendation in the 229th Number of the Spectator,
where Addison has also remarked, <span class="tei tei-q">“that several of our
countrymen, and Dryden in particular, seem very often to
have copied after this ode of Sappho, in their dramatic writings,

58. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ad Cœlium de Lesbia</span></span>. In this ode, addressed to one
of her former admirers, Catullus gives an account, both tender
and pathetic, of the debaucheries and degraded condition of
Lesbia, to his passion for whom, he had attributed such <a name="corr295a" id="corr295a" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">powerful</span>

61. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">In Nuptias Juliæ et Manlii</span></span>. We come now to the
three celebrated epithalamiums of Catullus. The first is in
honour of the nuptials of Julia and Manlius, who is generally
supposed to have been Aulus Manlius Torquatus, an intimate
friend of the poet, and a descendant of one of the most noble
patrician families in Rome. This poem has been entitled an
Epithalamium in most of the ancient editions, but Muretus contends
that this is an improper appellation, and that it should
be inscribed <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Carmen Nuptiale</span></span>. <span class="tei tei-q">“An epithalamium,”</span> he says,
<span class="tei tei-q">“was supposed to be sung by the virgins when the bride had
retired to the nuptial chamber, whereas in this poem an earlier
part of the ceremony is celebrated and described.”</span> This
earlier part, indeed, occupies the greater portion of the poem,
but towards the conclusion the bride is represented as placed
in the chamber of her husband, which may justify its ordinary
title:

Catullus now proceeds to describe the ceremonies with which
the bride was conveyed to the house of her husband, and was
there received. He feigns that he beholds the nuptial pomp
and retinue approaching, and encourages the bride to come
forth, by an elegant compliment to her beauty; as also, by
reminding her of the fair fame and character of her intended
husband. As she approaches, he intimates the freedom of
the ancient Fescennine verses, which were first sung at marriage
festivals.

This nuptial hymn has been the model of many epithalamiums,
particularly that of Jason and Creusa, sung by the
chorus in Seneca’s <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Medea</span></span>, and of Honorius and Maria, in
Claudian. The modern Latin poets, particularly Justus Lipsius,
have exercised themselves a great deal in this style of
composition; and most of them with evident imitation of the
work of Catullus. It has also been highly applauded by the
commentators; and more than one critic has declared that it
must have been written by the hands of Venus and the Graces—<span class="tei tei-q">“Veneris 
et Gratiarum manibus scriptum esse.”</span> I wish,
however, they had excepted from their unqualified panegyrics
the coarse imitation of the Fescennine poems, which leaves
on our minds a stronger impression of the prevalence and
extent of Roman vices, than any other passage in the Latin
classics. Martial, and Catullus himself elsewhere, have
branded their enemies; and Juvenal, in bursts of satiric indignation,
has reproached his countrymen with the most shocking
crimes. But here, in a complimentary poem to a patron and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page298">[pg 298]</span><a name="Pg298" id="Pg298" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>intimate friend, these are jocularly alluded to as the venial

62. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Carmen Nuptiale</span></span>. Some parts of this epithalamium

second nuptial hymn of Catullus may be regarded as a continuation
of the above poem, being also in honour of the
marriage of Manlius and Julia. The stanzas of the former were
supposed to be sung or recited in the person of the poet, who
only exhorted the chorus of youths and virgins to commence
the nuptial strain. But here these bands contend, in alternate
verses; the maids descanting on the beauty and advantages of
a single life, and the lads on those of marriage.

The maids who had accompanied the bride to her husband’s

however, by the youths hinting that they are not such enemies
to Hesper as they pretend to be. Then the maids, draw a
beautiful, and, with Catullus, a favourite comparison between
an unblemished virgin, and a delicate flower in a garden:

To the sentiment delineated by this image, the youths reply
by one scarcely less beautiful, emblematical of the happiness
of the married state; and as this was a theme in which the
maidens were probably not unwilling to be overcome, they
unite in the last stanza with the chorus of young men, in
recommending to the bride to act the part of a submissive
spouse.

It is evident that Ariosto has suggested several things to the
French poet, as he has also done to the imitators in our own

63. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De Ati</span></span>.—The story of Atis is one of the most mysterious
of the mythological emblems. The fable was explained
by Porphyry; and the Emperor Julian afterwards invented
and published an allegory of this mystic tale. According to
them, the voluntary emasculation of Atis was typical of the
revolution of the sun between the tropics, or the separation
of the human soul from vice and error. In the literal acceptation
in which it is presented by Catullus, the fable seems
an unpromising and rather a peculiar subject for poetry:
indeed, there is no example of a similar event being celebrated
in verse, except the various poems on the fate of
Abelard. It is likewise the only specimen we have in Latin
of the Galliambic measure; so called, because sung by Galli,
the effeminate votaries of Cybele. The Romans, being a more
sober and severe people than the Greeks, gave less encouragement
than they to the celebration of the rites of Bacchus,
and have poured forth but few dithyrambic lines. The genius
of their language and of their usual style of poetry, as well
as their own practical and imitative character, were unfavourable
to the composition of such bold, figurative, and discursive
strains. They have left no verses which can be strictly
called dithyrambic, except, perhaps, the nineteenth ode of
the second book of Horace, and a chorus in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Œdipus</span></span> of
Seneca. If not perfectly dithyrambic, the numbers of the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Atis</span></span> of Catullus are, however, strongly expressive of distraction
and enthusiasm. The violent bursts of passion are admirably
aided by the irresistible torrent of words, and by the
cadence of a measure powerfully denoting mental agony and
remorse. In this production, now unexampled in every sense
of the word, Catullus is no longer the light agreeable poet,
who counted the kisses of his mistress, and called on the
Cupids to lament her sparrow. His ideas are full of fire, and
his language of wildness: He pours forth his thoughts with
an energy, rapidity, and enthusiasm, so different from his usual
tone, and, indeed, from that of all Latin poets, that this production
has been supposed to be a translation from some
ancient Greek dithyrambic, of which it breathes all the passion
and poetic phrensy. The employment of long compound
epithets, which constantly recur in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Atis</span></span>,—

Atis, it appears from the poem of Catullus, was a beautiful
youth, probably of Greece, who, forsaking his home and
parents, sailed with a few companions to Phrygia, and, having
landed, hurried to the grove consecrated to the great goddess
Cybele,—

There, struck with superstitious phrensy, he qualified himself
for the service of that divinity; and, snatching the musical
instruments used in her worship, he exhorted his companions,
who had followed his example, to ascend to the temple of
Cybele. At this part of the poem, we follow the new votary
of the Phrygian goddess through all his wild traversing of
woods and mountains, till at length, having reached the temple,
Atis and his companions drop asleep, exhausted by fatigue
and mental distraction. Being tranquillized in some measure
by a night’s repose, Atis becomes sensible of the misery of
his situation; and, struck with horror at his rash deed, he
returns to the sea-shore. There he casts his eyes, bathed in
tears, over the ocean homeward; and comparing his former
happiness with his present wretched condition, he pours forth
a complaint unrivalled in energy and pathos. Gibbon talks
of the different emotions produced by the transition of Atis
from the wildest enthusiasm to sober pathetic complaint for
his irretrievable loss<a id="noteref_501" name="noteref_501" href="#note_501"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">501</span></span></a>; but, in fact, his complaint is not soberly
pathetic—to which the Galliambic measure would be little
suited: it is, on the contrary, the most impassioned expression
of mental agony and bitter regret in the wide compass of
Roman literature:

Muretus attempted a Latin Galliambic Address to Bacchus in
imitation of the measure employed in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Atis</span></span> of Catullus,
and he has strenuously tried to make his poem resemble its
model by an affected use of uncouth compound epithets.
Pigna, an Italian poet, has adopted similar numbers in a Latin
poem, on the metamorphosis of the water nymph, Pitys, who
was changed into a fir-tree, for having fled from the embraces
of Boreas. In many of the lines he has closely followed Catullus;
but it seems scarcely possible that any modern poet
could excite in his mind the enthusiasm essential for the production
of such works. Catullus probably believed as little
in Atis and Cybele as Muretus, but he lived among men who
did; and though his opinions might not be influenced, his imagination
was tinged with the colours of the age.

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Atis</span></span> is the name of one of the tragic operas of Quinault,
which, I believe, was the most popular of his pieces except
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Armide</span></span>; but it has little reference to the classic story of the
votary of Cybele. The French Atis is a vehement and powerful
lover, who elopes with the nymph Sangaride on the
wings of the Zephyrs, which had been placed by Cybele, who
was herself enamoured of the youth, at the disposal of Atis.
It seems a poor production in itself, (how different from the
operas of Metastasio!) but it was embellished by splendid scenery,
and the music of Lulli, adapted to the chorus of Phrygians,
and Zephyrs, and Dreams, and Streams, and Corybantes.

64. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Epithalamium Pelei et Thetidis</span></span>.—This is the longest
and most elaborate of the productions of Catullus. It displays
much accurate description, as well as pathetic and im<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page304">[pg 304]</span><a name="Pg304" id="Pg304" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>passioned incident. Catullus was a Greek scholar, and all
his commentators seem determined that his best poems should
be considered as of Greek invention. I do not believe, however,
that the whole of this epithalamium was taken from any
one poet of Greece, as the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Coma Berenices</span></span> was from Callimachus;
but the author undoubtedly borrowed a great deal
from various writers of that country. Hesiod wrote an Epithalamium,
<span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-family: Gentium, 'New Athena Unicode', 'DejaVu Serif', 'Lucida Grande', 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Palatino Linotype', serif">Ἐις Πηλεα και Θετιν</span></span><a id="noteref_502" name="noteref_502" href="#note_502"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">502</span></span></a>, some fragments of which have
been cited by Tzetzes, in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">prolegomena</span></span> to Lycophron’s
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cassandra</span></span>; and judging from these, it appears to have suggested
several lines of the epithalamium of Catullus. The
adornment, however, and propriety of its language, and the
usual practice of Catullus in other productions, render it probable,
that he has chiefly selected his beauties from the Alexandrian
poets. Valckenar, in his edition of Theocritus, (1779,)
has shown, that the Idyls of Theocritus, particularly the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Adoniazusi</span></span>, have been of much service to our Latin poet; and
a late German commentator has pointed out more than twenty
passages, in which he has not merely imitated, but actually
translated, Apollonius Rhodius<a id="noteref_503" name="noteref_503" href="#note_503"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">503</span></span></a>.

The proper subject of this epithalamium is the festivals held
in Thessaly in honour of the nuptials of Peleus and Thetis;
but it is chiefly occupied with a long episode, containing the
story of Ariadne. It commences with the sailing of the ship
Argo on the celebrated expedition to which that vessel has
given name. The Nereids were so much struck with the unusual
spectacle, that they all emerged from the deep; and
Thetis, one of their number, fell in love with Peleus, who had
accompanied the expedition, and who was instantly seized with
a reciprocal passion. Little is said as to the manner in which
the courtship was conducted, and the poet hastens to the preparations
for the nuptials. On this joyful occasion, all the inhabitants
of Thessaly flock to its capital, Pharsalia. Every
thing in the royal palace is on a magnificent scale; but the
poet chiefly describes the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">stragula</span></span>, or coverlet, of the nuptial
couch, on which was depicted the concluding part of the story
of Theseus and Ariadne. Ariadne is represented as standing
on the beach, where she had been abandoned, while asleep,
by Theseus, and gazing in fixed despair at the departing sail
of her false lover. Never was there a finer picture drawn of
complete mental desolation. She was incapable of exhibiting
violent signs of grief: She neither beats her bosom, nor bursts
into tears; but the diadem which had compressed her locks—the
light mantle which had floated around her form—the veil
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page305">[pg 305]</span><a name="Pg305" id="Pg305" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>which had covered her bosom—all neglected, and fallen at her
feet, were the sport of the waves which dashed the strand,
while she herself, regardless and stupified with horror at her
frightful situation, stood like the motionless statue of a Bacchante,—

Catullus, leaving Ariadne in the attitude above described,
recapitulates the incidents, by which she had been placed in
this agonizing situation. He relates, in some excellent lines,
the magnanimous enterprize of Theseus—his voyage, and arrival
in Crete: He gives us a picture of the youthful innocence
of Ariadne, reared in the bosom of her mother, like a myrtle
springing up on the solitary banks of the Euphrates, or a flower
whose blossom is brought forth by the breath of spring. The
combat of Theseus with the Minotaur is but shortly and coldly
described. It is obvious that the poet merely intended to
raise our idea of the valour of Theseus, so far as to bestow interest
and dignity on the passion of Ariadne, and to excuse
her for sacrificing to its gratification all feelings of domestic
duty and affection. Having yielded and accompanied her
lover, she was deserted by him, in that forlorn situation, her
deep sense of which had changed her to the likeness of a Bacchante
sculptured in stone. Her first feelings of horror and
astonishment had deprived her of the power of utterance; but

We are naturally led to compare with Catullus, the efforts
of his own countrymen, particularly those of Ovid and Virgil,
in portraying the agonies of deserted nymphs and princesses.
Both these poets have borrowed largely from their predecessor.
Ovid has treated the subject of Ariadne not less than
four times. In the epistle of Ariadne to Theseus, he has
painted, like Catullus, her disordered person—her sense of
desertion, and remembrance of the benefits she had conferred
on Theseus: But the epistle is a cold production, chiefly
because her grief is not immediately presented before us; and
she merely tells that she had wept, and sighed, and raved.
The minute detail, too, into which she enters, is inconsistent
with her vehement passion. She recollects too well each
heap of sand which retarded her steps, and the thorns on the
summit of the mountain. Returning from her wanderings,
she addresses her couch, of which she asks advice, till she
becomes overpowered by apprehension for the wild beasts and
marine monsters, of which she presents her false lover with
a faithful catalogue. The simple ideas of Catullus are frequently
converted into conceits, and his natural bursts of
passion, into quibbles and artificial points. In the eighth
book of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Metamorphoses</span></span>, the melancholy part of Ariadne’s
story is only recalled, in order to introduce the transformation
of her crown into a star. In the third book of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Fasti</span></span>, she
deplores the double desertion of Theseus and Bacchus. It
is in the first book of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Art of Love</span></span>, that Ovid approaches
nearest to Catullus, particularly in the sudden contrast between
the solitude and melancholy of Ariadne, and the revelry of
the Bacchanalians. Some of Virgil’s imitations of Catullus
have been already pointed out: But part of the complaint of
Dido is addressed to her betrayer, and contains a bitterness
of sarcasm, and eloquence of reproof, which neither Catullus
nor Ovid could reach.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The desertion of Olimpia by Bireno, related in the tenth
canto of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Orlando Furioso</span></span>, has, in its incidents at least, a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page309">[pg 309]</span><a name="Pg309" id="Pg309" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>strong resemblance to the poem of Catullus. Bireno, Duke
of Zealand, while on a voyage from Holland to his own
country, touches on Frisia; and, being smit with love for
Olimpia, daughter of the king, carries her off with him; but,
in the farther progress of the voyage, he lands on a desert
island, and, while Olimpia is asleep, he leaves her, and sets
sail in the darkness of night. Olimpia awakes, and, finding
herself alone, hurries to the beach, and then ascends a rock,
whence she descries, by light of the moon, the departing sail
of her lover. Here, and afterwards while in her tent, she
pours forth her plaints against the treachery of Bireno. In
the details of this story, Ariosto has chiefly copied from Ovid;
but he has also availed himself of several passages in Catullus.
As Ariosto, in his story of Olimpia, principally chose Ovid for
his model, so Tasso, in that of Armida, seems chiefly to have
kept his eye on Virgil and Catullus. But Armida is not like
Ariadne, an injured and innocent maid, nor a stately queen,
like Dido; but a voluptuous and artful magician,

It has been mentioned, that the desertion of Ariadne was
represented on one compartment of the coverlet of the nuptial
couch of Peleus—on another division of it the story of Bacchus
and Ariadne was exhibited. The introduction of Bacchus
and his train closes the episode with an animated picture, and
forms a pleasing contrast to the melancholy scenes that precede
it. At the same time, the poet, delicately breaking off
without even hinting at the fair one’s ready acceptance of her
new lover, leaves the pity we feel for her abandonment unweakened
on the mind.

65. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ad Ortalum</span></span>. This is the first of the elegies of Catullus,
and indeed the earliest of any length or celebrity which had
hitherto appeared in the Latin language. Elegies were originally
written by the Greeks in alternate hexameter and pentameter
lines, <span class="tei tei-q">“versibus impariter junctis.”</span> This measure,
which was at first appropriated to deplore misfortunes, particularly
the loss of friends, was soon employed to complain of
unsuccessful love, and, by a very easy transition, to describe
the delights of gratified passion:

Matters were in this state in the age of Mimnermus, who was

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page310">[pg 310]</span><a name="Pg310" id="Pg310" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>poet of the Greeks. Hence, from his time every poem in that
measure, whatever was the subject, came to be denominated
elegy. The mixed species of verse, however, was always
considered essential, so that the complaint of Bion on the
death of Adonis, or that of Moschus on the loss of Bion, is
hardly accounted such, being written in a different sort of
measure. In the strict acceptation of the term, scarcely any
Greek elegy has descended to us entire, except perhaps a few
lines by Callimachus on the death of Heraclitus.

66. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De Coma Berenices</span></span>, is the poem alluded to in the former
elegy: it is translated from a production of Callimachus, of

Callimachus was esteemed by all antiquity as the finest
elegiac poet of Greece, or at least as next in merit to Mimnermus.
He belonged to the poetic school which flourished
at Alexandria from the time of Ptolemy Philadelphus to that
of Ptolemy Physcon, and which still sheds a lustre over the
dynasty of the Lagides, in spite of the crimes and personal
deformities with which their names have been sarcastically
associated.

After the partition of the Greek empire among the successors
of Alexander, the city to which he had given name became
the capital of the literary world; and arts and learning
long continued to be protected even by the most degenerate
of the Ptolemies. But the school which subsisted at Alexandria
was of a very different taste and description from that
which had flourished at Athens in the age of Pericles. In
Egypt the Greeks became a more learned, and perhaps a more
philosophical people, than they had been in the days of their
ancient glory at home; but they were no longer a nation, and
with their freedom their whole strength of feeling, and peculiar
tone of mind, were lost. Servitude and royal munificence,
with the consequent spirit of flattery which crept in, and even
the enormous library of Alexandria, were injurious to the
elastic and native spring of poetic fancy. The Egyptian
court was crowded with men of erudition, instead of such
men of genius as had thronged the theatre and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Agora</span></span> of
Athens. The courtly <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">literati</span></span>, the academicians, and the librarians
of Alexandria, were distinguished as critics, grammarians,
geographers, or geometricians. With them poetry
became a matter of study, not of original genius or invention,
and consequently never reached its highest flights. Though
not without amenity and grace, they wanted that boldness,
sublimity, and poetic enthusiasm by which the bards of the
Greek republics were inspired. When, like Apollonius Rhodius,
they attempted poetry of the highest class, they rose
not above an elegant mediocrity; or when they attained perfection,
as in the instance of Theocritus, it was in the inferior
and more delicate branches of the art. Accordingly, these
erudite and ornate poets chiefly selected as the subjects of
their muse didactic topics of astronomy and physics, or ob<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page312">[pg 312]</span><a name="Pg312" id="Pg312" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>scure traditions derived from ancient fable. Lycophron immersed
himself in such a sea of fabulous learning, that he
became nearly unintelligible, and all of them were marked
with the blemishes of affectation and obscurity, into which
learned poets are most apt to fall. Among the pleiad of
Alexandrian poets, none had so many of the faults and beauties
of the school to which he belonged as Callimachus. He
was conspicuous for his profound knowledge of the ancient
traditions of Greece, for his poetic art and elegant versification,
but he was also noted for deficiency of invention and
original genius:—

The poem of Catullus has some faults, which may be fairly
attributed to his pedantic model—a certain obscurity in point
of diction, and that ostentatious display of erudition, which
characterized the works of the Alexandrian poets. The
Greek original, however, being lost, except two distichs, it is
impossible to institute an accurate comparison; but the Latin
appears to be considerably more diffuse than the Greek. One
distich, which is still extant in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Scholia</span></span> on Apollonius, has
been expanded by Catullus into three lines; and the following

The Latin poem, like its Greek original, is in elegiac verse,
and is supposed to be spoken by the constellation called
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Coma Berenices</span></span>. It relates how Berenice, the queen and
sister of Ptolemy, (Euergetes,) vowed the consecration of her
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page313">[pg 313]</span><a name="Pg313" id="Pg313" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>locks to the immortals, provided her husband was restored to
her, safe and successful, from a military expedition on which
he had proceeded against the Assyrians. The king having
returned according to her wish, and her shorn locks having
disappeared, it is supposed by one of those fictions which
poetry alone can admit, that Zephyrus, the son of Aurora,
and brother of Memnon, had carried them up to heaven, and
thrown them into the lap of Venus, by whom they were set in
the sky, and were soon afterwards discovered among the constellations
by Conon, a court astronomer. In order to relish
this poem, or to enter into its spirit, we must read it imbued
as it were with the belief and manners of the ancient Egyptians.
The locks of Berenice might be allowed to speak and
desire, because they had been converted into stars, which, by
an ancient philosophic system, were supposed to be possessed
of animation and intelligence. Similar honours had been
conferred on the crown of Ariadne and the ship of Isis, and
the belief in such transformations was at least of that popular
or traditionary nature which fitted them for the purposes of
poetry. The race, too, of the Egyptian Ptolemies, traced
their lineage to Jupiter, which would doubtless facilitate the
reception of the locks of Berenice among the heavenly orbs.
Adulation, however, it must be confessed, could not be carried
higher; the beautiful locks of Berenice, though metamorphosed
into stars, are represented as regretting their former
happy situation, and prefer adorning the brow of Berenice, to
blazing by night in the front of heaven, under the steps of
immortals, or reposing by day in the bosom of Tethys:—

sufficiently elegant versification; but what in Callimachus is

Statius a servile and disgusting adulation of the loathsome
monster, whose vices he so disgracefully flattered. Antonio
Sebastiani, a Latin poet of modern Italy, has imitated Catullus,
by celebrating the locks of a princess of San-Severino. The
beauty and virtues of his heroine had excited the admiration
of earth, and the love of the gods, but with these the jealousy
of the goddesses. By their influence, a malady evoked from
Styx threatens the life of the princess, and occasions the loss
of her hair. The gods, indignant at this base conspiracy,
commission Iris to convey the fallen locks to the sky, and to
restore to the princess, along with health, her former freshness

Catullus seems to have entertained a sincere affection for his
brother, and to have deeply deplored his loss; hence he generally
writes well when touching on this tender topic. Indeed,
the only remaining elegy of Catullus worth mentioning, is
that entitled <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Inferiæ ad Fratris Tumulum</span></span>, which is another
beautiful and affectionate tribute to the memory of this beloved
youth. Vulpius had said, in a commentary on Catullus,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
None of the remaining poems of Catullus, though written
in elegiac verse, are at all of the description to which we
now give the name of elegy. They are usually termed epigrams,
and contain the most violent invectives on living characters,
for the vices in which they indulged, and satire the
most unrestrained on their personal deformities; but few of
them are epigrams in the modern acceptation of the word.
An epigram, as is well known, was originally what we now
call a device or inscription, and the term remained, though
the thing itself was changed<a id="noteref_511" name="noteref_511" href="#note_511"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">511</span></span></a>. A Greek anthology consisting
of poems which expressed a simple idea—a sentiment, regret,
or wish, without point or double meaning, had been compiled
by Meleager before the time of Catullus; and hence he had
an opportunity of imitating the style of the Greek epigrams,
and occasionally borrowing their expressions, though generally
with application to some of his enemies at Rome, whom
he wished to hold up to the derision or hatred of his countrymen.
Most of these poems were called forth by real occurrences,
and express, without disguise, his genuine feelings at
the time: His contempt, dislike, and resentment, all burst
out in poetry. So little is known concerning the circumstances
of his life, or the history of his enmities or friendships,
that some of the lighter productions of Catullus are nearly
unintelligible, while others appear flat and obscure; and in
none can we fully relish the felicity of expression or allusion.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These epigrams of Catullus are chiefly curious and valuable,
when considered as occasional or extemporary productions,
which paint the manners, as well as echo the tone of thought
and feeling, which at the time prevailed in fashionable society
at Rome. What chiefly obtrudes itself on our attention, is the
gross personal invective, and indecency of these compositions,
so foreign from anything that would be tolerated in modern
times. The art of rendering others satisfied with themselves,
and consequently with us—the practice of dissembling our
feelings, at first to please, and then by habit,—the custom, if
not of flattering our foes, at least of meeting those we dislike,
without reviling them, were talents unknown in the ancient
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page316">[pg 316]</span><a name="Pg316" id="Pg316" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>republic of Rome. The freedom of the times was accompanied
by a frankness and sincerity of language, which we
would consider as rude. Even the best friends attacked each
other in the Senate, and before the various tribunals of justice,
in the harshest and most unmeasured terms of abuse. Philip
of Macedon, in an amicable interview with the Roman general
Flaminius, who was accounted the most polite man of his
day, apologized for not having returned an immediate answer
to some proposition which had been made to him, on the
ground that none of those friends, with whom he was in the
habit of consulting, were at hand when he received it; to
which Flaminius replied, that the reason he had no friends
near him was, that he had assassinated them all. Matters
were little better in the days of Catullus. At the time he
flourished, everything was made subservient to political advancement;
and what <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">we</span></span> should consider as the most inexpiable
offences, were forgotten, or at least forgiven, as soon
as the interests of ambition required. Accordingly, no person
seems to have blamed the bitter invectives of Catullus; and
none of his contemporaries were surprised or shocked at the
unbridled freedom with which he reviled his enemies. He
was merely considered as availing himself of a privilege,
which every one was entitled to exercise. In his days, ridicule
and raillery were oftener directed by malice than by wit:
But the Romans thought no terms unseemly, which expressed
the utmost bitterness of private or political animosity, and an
excess of malevolence was received as sufficient compensation
for deficiency in liveliness or humour. As little were the
Romans offended by the obscene images and expressions
which Catullus so frequently employed. Such had not yet
been proscribed in the conversation of the best company.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Among the ancients,”</span> says Porson, in his review of Brunck’s
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Aristophanes</span></span><a id="noteref_512" name="noteref_512" href="#note_512"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">512</span></span></a>, <span class="tei tei-q">“plain speaking was the fashion; nor was that
ceremonious delicacy introduced, which has taught men to
abuse each other with the utmost politeness, and express the
most indecent ideas in the most modest language. The
ancients had little of this: They were accustomed to call a
spade, a spade—to give everything its proper name. There
is another sort of indecency which is infinitely more dangerous,
which corrupts the heart without offending the ear.”</span>
Hence the Muse of light poetry thought not of having recourse
to the circumlocutions or suggestions of modern times.
Nor did Catullus suffer in his reputation, either as an author
or man of fashion, from the impurities by which his poems
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page317">[pg 317]</span><a name="Pg317" id="Pg317" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>were poisoned. All this would have been less remarkable in
the first age of Roman literature, as indelicacy of expression
is characteristic of the early poetry of almost every nation.
The French epigrams of Regnier, and his contemporaries
Motin and Berthelot, are nearly as gross as those of Catullus;
but at the close of the Roman republic, literature was far advanced;
and if it be true, that as a nation grows corrupted its
language becomes pure, the words and expressions of the
Romans, in these last days of liberty, should have been sufficiently
chaste. The obscenities of Catullus, however, it must be
admitted, are oftener the sport of satire, than the ebullitions of
a voluptuous imagination. His sarcastic account of the debaucheries
of Lesbia, is more impure than the pictures of his
enjoyment of her love.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
No subject connected with the works of Catullus is more
curious than the different sentiments, which, as we have seen,
he expresses with regard to this woman. His conflict of
mind breathes into his poetry every variety of passion. We
behold him now transported with love, now reviling and despising
her as sunk in the lowest abyss of shame, and yet,
with this full knowledge of her abandoned character, her
blandishments preserve undiminished sway over his affections.
<span class="tei tei-q">“At one time,”</span> says a late translator of Catullus, <span class="tei tei-q">“we find
him upbraiding Lesbia bitterly with her licentiousness, then
bidding her farewell for ever; then beseeching from the gods
resolution to cast her off; then weakly confessing utter impotence
of mind, and submission to hopeless slavery; then, in
the epistle to Manlius, persuading himself, by reason and example,
into a contented acquiescence in her falsehoods, and
yet at last accepting with eagerness, and relying with hope,
on her proffered vow of constancy. Nothing can be more
genuine than the rapture with which he depicts his happiness
in her hours of affection; nor than the gloomy despair with
which he is overwhelmed, when he believes himself resolved
to quit her for ever.”</span> And all this, he wrote and circulated
concerning a Roman lady, belonging, it is believed, to one
of the first and most powerful families of the state!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Lesbia, as formerly mentioned, is universally allowed to be
Clodia, the sister of the turbulent Clodius; but there has been
a great deal of discussion and dispute, with regard to the
identity of the other individuals against whom the epigrams
are directed. Justus Lipsius<a id="noteref_513" name="noteref_513" href="#note_513"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">513</span></span></a> has written a dissertation with
regard to Vettius and Cominius. The former he supposes to
be the person mentioned in Cicero’s Letters to Atticus, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page318">[pg 318]</span><a name="Pg318" id="Pg318" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>by Suetonius, as having been suborned by Cæsar, to allow
himself to be seized with a weapon on his person, and to
confess that he had been employed by the Chiefs of the Senate
to assassinate Pompey—a device contrived by Cæsar, in
order to set Pompey and the Senate at variance. Cominius
was an accuser by profession, and impeached C. Cornelius,
whom Cicero defended<a id="noteref_514" name="noteref_514" href="#note_514"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">514</span></span></a>. Lipsius believes Alphenus to be
Pompey, and thinks that the epigram, directed against him, is
supposed to be written in the person of Cicero. He is of
opinion that the poet durst not venture to mention Pompey’s
name, and therefore designed him by an assumed one; but
the epigrams on Julius Cæsar prove that Catullus was neither
so scrupulous nor timid. The greatest number, however, and
the most cutting of the epigrams, are aimed at Gellius, his
successful rival in the affections of Lesbia—

There were two persons of this name at Rome in the time of
Catullus—an uncle and nephew. The first was a notorious
profligate, who had wasted his patrimony, and afterwards
headed mobs in the Forum for hire<a id="noteref_515" name="noteref_515" href="#note_515"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">515</span></span></a>. The nephew was equally
dissolute. After the death of Cæsar, he conspired to assassinate
Cassius in the midst of his army, and, having been pardoned,
deserted to Antony. One of the various crimes of
which he was suspected, identifies him as the Gellius branded
by our poet, and whose vices were so great—

Much dispute has existed with regard to the comparative
merit of the epigrammatic productions of Catullus, and those
of Martial, who sharpened the Latin epigram, and endeavoured
to surprise, by terminating an ordinary thought with
some word or expression, which formed a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">point</span></span>. Of the three
great triumvirs of Latin literature, Joseph Scaliger, Lipsius,
and Muretus, the last considers Catullus as far superior to his
successor, as the wit of a gentleman to that of a scoffer and
buffoon, while the two former award the palm to Martial.
Their respective merits are very well summed up by Vavassor.—<span class="tei tei-q">“Catullum
quidem, puro ac simplici candore, et nativa quadam,
minimeque adscita, excellere venustate formæ, quæ accedat

There can, I think, be no doubt, that, as an epigrammatist,
Martial is infinitely superior to Catullus; but it is not on his
epigrams that the fame of Catullus rests: He owes his reputation
to about a dozen pieces, in which every word, like a
note of music, thrills on the heart-strings. It is this felicitous
selection of the most <a name="corr319" id="corr319" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">appropriate</span> and melodious expressions,

amatory passion—more heartfelt tenderness in grief—and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page320">[pg 320]</span><a name="Pg320" id="Pg320" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>none, certainly, ever possessed a more happy art of embellishing
trivial incidents, by the manner in which he treated
them. Indeed, the most exquisite of his productions, in point
of grace and delicacy, are those which were called forth by
the most trifling occasions; while, at the same time, his Epithalamium
of Peleus and Thetis proves, that he was by no
means deficient in that warmth of imagination, energy of
thought, and sublimity of conception, which form the attributes
of perfection in those bards who tread the higher paths
of Parnassus. Catullus is a great favourite with all the early
critics and commentators of the 16th century. The elder
Scaliger alone has pronounced on him a harsh and unmerited
sentence: <span class="tei tei-q">“Catullo,”</span> says he, <span class="tei tei-q">“docti nomen quare sit ab antiquis
attributum, neque apud alios comperi, neque dum in

may, perhaps, like to hear the opinion of the pure and saintly

The different sorts of poetry which Catullus, though not
their inventor, first introduced at Rome, were cultivated and
brought to high perfection by his countrymen. Horace followed,
and excelled him in Lyric compositions. The elegiac
measure was adopted with success by Ovid, Tibullus, and
Propertius, and applied by them to the expression of amatory
sentiments, which, if they did not reach the refinement, or
pure devotedness of the middle ages<a id="noteref_519" name="noteref_519" href="#note_519"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">519</span></span></a>, were less gross than

Licinius Calvus was equally distinguished as an orator and
a poet. In the former capacity he is mentioned with distinction
by Cicero; but it was probably his poetical talents that
procured for him the friendship of Catullus, who has addressed
to him two Odes, in which he is commemorated as a most
delightful companion, from whose society he could scarcely
refrain. Calvus was violently enamoured of a girl called
Quintilia, whose early death he lamented in a number of verses,
none of which have descended to us. There only remain,
an epigram against Pompey, satirizing his practice of scratching
his head with one finger, and a fragment of another
against Julius Cæsar<a id="noteref_523" name="noteref_523" href="#note_523"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">523</span></span></a>. The sarcasm it contains would not
have been pardonable in the present age; but the dictator,

desirous of a reconciliation, addressed a letter to him, with
assurances of unaltered friendship<a id="noteref_524" name="noteref_524" href="#note_524"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">524</span></span></a>. The fragments of his

During the period in which the works of Lucretius and
Catullus brought the Latin language to such perfection, the
drama, which we have seen so highly elevated in the days of
the Scipios, had sunk into a state of comparative degradation.
National circumstances and manners had never been favourable
to the progress of the dramatic art at Rome; but, subsequently
to the conquest of Carthage, the increasing size and
magnificence of the Roman theatres, some of which held not
less than 60,000 people, required splendid spectacles, or extravagant
buffoonery, to fill the eye, and catch the attention
of a crowded, and often tumultuous assembly.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Accordingly, in the long period from the termination of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page324">[pg 324]</span><a name="Pg324" id="Pg324" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Punic wars till the Augustan age, there scarcely appeared a single
successor to Plautus or Pacuvius. That the pieces of the
ancient tragic or comic writers still continued to be occasionally
represented, is evident from the immense wealth amassed,
in the time of Cicero, by Æsopus and Roscius, who never, so
far as we know, condescended to appear, except in the regular
drama; but a new tragedy or comedy was rarely brought out.
This deficiency in the fund of entertainment and novelty, in
the province of the legitimate drama, was supplied by the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Mimes</span></span>, which now became fashionable in Rome.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Though resembling them in name, the Latin Mimes differed
essentially from the Greek <span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-family: Gentium, 'New Athena Unicode', 'DejaVu Serif', 'Lucida Grande', 'Arial Unicode MS', 'Palatino Linotype', serif">Μιμοι</span></span>, from which they derived their
appellation. The Greek Mimes, of which Sophron of Syracuse
was the chief writer, represented a single adventure
taken from ordinary life, and exhibited characters without any
gross caricature or buffoonery. The fifteenth Idyl of Theocritus
is said to be written in the manner of the Greek Mimes<a id="noteref_530" name="noteref_530" href="#note_530"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">530</span></span></a>;
and, to judge from it, they were not so much actions as conversations
with regard to some action which was supposed to
be going on at the time, and is pointed out, as it were, by the
one interlocutor to the other, or an imitation of the action,
whence their name has been derived. They resembled detached
or unconnected scenes of a comedy, and required no
more gesticulation or mimetic art, than is employed in all
dramatic representations. On the other hand, mimetic gestures
of every species, except dancing, were essential to the
Roman Mimes, as also the exhibition of grotesque characters,
which had often no prototypes in real life. The Mimes of the
Romans, again, differed from their pantomime in this, that, in
the former, most of the gestures were accompanied by recitation,
whereas the pantomimic entertainments, carried to such
perfection by Pylades and Bathyllus, were <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ballets</span></span>, often of a
serious, and never of a ludicrous or grotesque description, in
which everything was expressed by dumb show, and in which
dancing constituted so considerable a part of the amusement,
that the performers danced a poem, a chorus, or whole drama,
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Canticum saltabant</span></span>.)
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is much more difficult to distinguish the Mimes from the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Fabulæ Atellanæ</span></span>, than from the Pantomimes or Greek <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Mimi</span></span>;
and indeed they have been frequently confounded<a id="noteref_531" name="noteref_531" href="#note_531"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">531</span></span></a>. It appears,
however, that the characters represented in the Atellane
dramas were chiefly provincial, while those introduced in the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page325">[pg 325]</span><a name="Pg325" id="Pg325" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Mimes were the lowest class of citizens at Rome. Antic gestures,
too, were more employed in the Mimes than the Atellane
fables, and they were more obscene and ludicrous: <span class="tei tei-q">“Toti,”</span>
says Vossius, <span class="tei tei-q">“erant ridiculi.”</span> The Atellanes, though full of
mirth, were always tempered with something of the ancient
Italian severity, and consisted of a more liberal and polite kind
of humour than the Mimes. In this respect Cicero places the
Mimes and Atellane fables in contrast, in a letter to Papyrius
Pætus, where he says, that the broad jests in which his correspondent
had indulged, immediately after having quoted the
tragedy of Œnomaus, reminds him of the modern method of
introducing, at the end of such graver dramatic pieces, the
buffoonery of the Mimes, instead of the more delicate humour
of the old Atellane farces<a id="noteref_532" name="noteref_532" href="#note_532"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">532</span></span></a>.

These Mimes, (which, with the Atellane fables, and regular
tragedy and comedy, form the four great branches of the Roman
drama,) were represented by actors, who sometimes wore
masks, but more frequently had their faces stained like our
clowns or mountebanks. There was always one principal
actor, on whom the jests and ridicule chiefly hinged. The
second, or inferior parts, were entirely subservient to that of
the first performer: They were merely introduced to set him
off to advantage, to imitate his actions, and take up his words—

Some writers have supposed, that a Mime was a sort of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">monodrame</span></span>,
and that the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">partes secundæ</span></span>, here alluded to by Horace,
meant the part of the actor who gesticulated<a id="noteref_533" name="noteref_533" href="#note_533"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">533</span></span></a>, while the other

however, from the context of the lines, that Horace refers to
the inferior characters of the Mime<a id="noteref_535" name="noteref_535" href="#note_535"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">535</span></span></a>. I doubt not that the
chief performer assumed more than one character in the
course of the piece<a id="noteref_536" name="noteref_536" href="#note_536"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">536</span></span></a>, in the manner in which the Admirable

fool or a parasite, who assisted in carrying on the jests or

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The performance of a Mime commenced with the appearance
of the chief actor, who explained its subject in a sort of
prologue, in order that the spectators might fully understand
what was but imperfectly represented by words or gestures.
This prolocutor, also, was generally the author of a sketch of
the piece; but the actors were not confined to the mere outline
which he had furnished. In one view, the province of the
mimetic actor was of a higher description than that of the
regular comedian. He was obliged to trust not so much
to memory as invention, and to clothe in extemporaneous
effusions of his own, those rude sketches of dramatic scenes,
which were all that were presented to him by his author.
The performers of Mimes, however, too often gave full scope,
not merely to natural unpremeditated gaiety, but abandoned
themselves to every sort of extravagant and indecorous action.
The part written out was in iambic verse, but the extemporary
dialogue which filled up the scene was in prose, or in the
rudest species of versification. Through the course of the
exhibition, the want of refinement or dramatic interest was
supplied by the excellence of the mimetic part, and the
amusing imitation of the peculiarities or personal habits of
various classes of society. The performers were seldom
anxious to give a reasonable conclusion to their extravagant
intrigue. Sometimes, when they could not extricate themselves
from the embarrassment into which they had thrown
each other, they simultaneously rushed off the stage, and the
performance terminated<a id="noteref_540" name="noteref_540" href="#note_540"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">540</span></span></a>.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The characters exhibited were parts taken from the dregs
of the populace—courtezans, thieves, and drunkards. The
Sannio, or Zany, seems to have been common to the Mimes
and Atellane dramas. He excited laughter by lolling out his
tongue, and making asses’ ears on his head with his fingers.
There was also the Panniculus, who appeared in a party-coloured
dress, with his head shaved, feigning stupidity or
folly, and allowing blows to be inflicted on himself without
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page327">[pg 327]</span><a name="Pg327" id="Pg327" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>cause or moderation. That women performed characters in
these dramas, and were often the favourite mistresses of the
great, is evident from a passage in the Satires of Horace, who
mentions a female Mime, called Origo, on whom a wealthy
Roman had lavished his paternal inheritance<a id="noteref_541" name="noteref_541" href="#note_541"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">541</span></span></a>. Cornelius
Gallus wrote four books of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Elegies</span></span> in praise of a Mime called
Cytheris, who, as Aurelius Victor informs us, was also beloved
by Antony and Brutus—<span class="tei tei-q">“Cytheridam Mimam, cum Antonio
et Gallo, amavit Brutus.”</span> It appears from a passage in Valerius
Maximus, that these Mimæ were often required to strip
themselves of their clothes in presence of the spectators<a id="noteref_542" name="noteref_542" href="#note_542"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">542</span></span></a>.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As might be expected from the characters introduced, the
Mimes were appropriated to a representation of the lowest
follies and debaucheries of the vulgar. <span class="tei tei-q">“Argumenta,”</span> says
Valerius Maximus, <span class="tei tei-q">“majore ex parte, stuprorum continent
actus.”</span> That they were in a great measure occupied with
the tricks played by wives on their husbands, (somewhat, probably,
in the style of those related by the Italian novelists,)
we learn from Ovid; who, after complaining in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tristia</span></span> of
having been undeservedly condemned for the freedom of his
verses, asks—

much the most popular subjects,—

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The same poet elsewhere calls the Mimes, <span class="tei tei-q">“Imitantes turpia
Mimos;”</span> and Diomedes defines them to be <span class="tei tei-q">“Sermonis cujuslibet,
motûsque, sine reverentiâ, vel factorum turpium cum
lasciviâ imitatio, ita ut ridiculum faciant.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These Mimes were originally represented as a sort of afterpiece,
or interlude to the regular dramas, and were intended
to fill up the blank which had been left by omission of the
Chorus. But they subsequently came to form a separate and
fashionable public amusement, which in a great measure superseded
all other dramatic entertainments. Sylla (in whom the
gloomy temper of the tyrant was brightened by the talents of
a mimic and a wit) was so fond of Mimes, that he gave the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page328">[pg 328]</span><a name="Pg328" id="Pg328" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>actors of them many acres of the public land<a id="noteref_544" name="noteref_544" href="#note_544"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">544</span></span></a>; and we shall soon
see the high importance which Julius Cæsar attached to this
sort of spectacle. It appears, at first view, curious, that the
Romans—the most grave, solid, and dignified nation on earth,
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">gens togata</span></span>, and the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">domini rerum</span></span>—should have been so
partial to the exhibition of licentious buffoonery on the stage.
But, perhaps, when people have a mind to divert themselves,
they choose what is most different from their ordinary temper
and habits, as being most likely to amuse them. <span class="tei tei-q">“Strangely,”</span>
says Isaac Bey, while relating his adventures in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">France</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">“was
my poor Turkish brain puzzled, on discovering the favourite
pastime of a nation reckoned the merriest in the world. It consisted
in a thing called tragedies, whose only purpose is to
make you cry your eyes out. Should the performance raise
a single smile, the author is undone<a id="noteref_545" name="noteref_545" href="#note_545"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">545</span></span></a>.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The popularity and frequent repetition of the Mimes came
gradually to purify their grossness; and the writers of them,
at length, were not contented merely with the fame of amusing
the Roman populace by ribaldry. They carried their pretensions
higher; and, while they sometimes availed themselves
of the licentious freedom to which this species of drama gave
unlimited indulgence, they interspersed the most striking truths
and beautiful moral maxims in these ludicrous and indecent
farces. This appears from the Mimes of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Decimus Laberius</span></span>
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Publius Syrus</span></span>, who both flourished during the dictatorship
of Julius Cæsar.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In earlier periods, as has been already mentioned, the writer
was also the chief representer of the Mime. Laberius, however,
was not originally an actor, but a Roman knight of
respectable family and character, who occasionally amused
himself with the composition of these farcical productions.
He was at length requested by Julius Cæsar to appear on the
stage after he had reached the age of sixty, and act the
Mimes, which he had sketched or written<a id="noteref_546" name="noteref_546" href="#note_546"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">546</span></span></a>. Aware that the
entreaties of a perpetual dictator are nearly equivalent to
commands, he reluctantly complied; but in the prologue to
the first piece which he acted, he complained bitterly to the
audience of the degradation to which he had been subjected—

The whole prologue, consisting of twenty-nine lines, which
have been preserved by Macrobius, is written in a fine vein of
poetry, and with all the high spirit of a Roman citizen. It
breathes in every verse the most bitter and indignant feelings
of wounded pride, and highly exalts our opinion of the man,
who, yielding to an irresistible power, preserved his dignity
while performing a part which he despised. It is difficult to
conceive how, in this frame of mind, he could assume the
jocund and unrestrained gaiety of a Mime, or how the Roman
people could relish so painful a spectacle. He is said, however,
to have represented the feigned character with inimitable
grace and spirit. But in the course of his performance he
could not refrain from expressing strong sentiments of freedom
and detestation of tyranny. In one of the scenes he
personated a Syrian slave; and, while escaping from the lash

It was not merely to entertain the people, who would have
been as well amused with the representation of any other
actor; nor to wound the private feelings of Laberius, that
Cæsar forced him on the stage. His sole object was to degrade
the Roman knighthood, to subdue their spirit of independence
and honour, and to strike the people with a sense of his unlimited
sway. This policy formed part of the same system which
afterwards led him to persuade a senator to combat among
the ranks of gladiators. The practice introduced by Cæsar
became frequent during the reigns of his successors; and in
the time of Domitian, the Fabii and Mamerci acted as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">planipedes</span></span>,
the lowest class of buffoons, who, barefooted and
smeared with soot, capered about the stage in the intervals
of the play for the amusement of the rabble!

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Though Laberius complied with the wishes of Cæsar, in
exhibiting himself on the stage, and acquitted himself with
ability as a mimetic actor, it would appear that the Dictator
had been hurt and offended by the freedoms which he used
in the course of the representation, and either on this or some
subsequent occasion bestowed the dramatic crown on a Syrian
slave, in preference to the Roman knight. Laberius submitted
with good grace to this fresh humiliation; he pretended to
regard it merely as the ordinary chance of theatric competition,
as he expressed to the audience in the following lines:—

Laberius did not long survive this double mortification: he
retired from Rome, and died at Puteoli about ten months after
the assassination of Cæsar<a id="noteref_550" name="noteref_550" href="#note_550"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">550</span></span></a>.

The titles and a few fragments of forty-three of the Mimes
of Laberius are still extant; but, excepting the prologue,
these remains are too inconsiderable and detached to enable
us to judge of their subject or merits. It would appear that
he occasionally dramatized the passing follies or absurd oc<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page331">[pg 331]</span><a name="Pg331" id="Pg331" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>currences of the day: for Cicero, writing to the lawyer Trebonius,
who expected to accompany Cæsar from Gaul to
Britain, tells him he had best return to Rome quickly, as a
longer pursuit to no purpose would be so ridiculous a circumstance,
that it would hardly escape the drollery of that arch
fellow Laberius; and what a burlesque character, he continues,
would a British lawyer furnish out for the Roman stage<a id="noteref_551" name="noteref_551" href="#note_551"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">551</span></span></a>!

According to Aulus Gellius, Laberius has taken too much
license in inventing words; and that author also gives various
examples of his use of obsolete expressions, or such as were
employed only by the lowest dregs of the people<a id="noteref_553" name="noteref_553" href="#note_553"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">553</span></span></a>. Horace
seems to have considered an admiration of the Mimes of Laberius

from considering Horace as an infallible judge of true
poetical excellence. He evidently attached more importance
to correctness and terseness of style, than to originality of
genius or fertility of invention. I am convinced he would
not have admired Shakspeare: He would have considered
Addison and Pope as much finer poets, and would have included
Falstaff, and Autolycus, and Sir Toby Belch, the
clowns and the boasters of our great dramatist, in the same
censure which he bestows on the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Plautinos sales</span></span> and the Mimes

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The celebrated Mime, called Publius Syrus, was brought
from Asia to Italy in early youth, in the same vessel with his
countryman and kinsman, Manlius Antiochus, the professor
of astrology, and Staberius Eros, the grammarian, who all, by
some desert in learning, rose above their original fortune.
He received a good education and liberty from his master, in
reward for his witticisms and facetious disposition. He first
represented his Mimes in the provincial towns of Italy, whence,
his fame having spread to Rome, he was summoned to the
capital, to assist in those public spectacles which Cæsar afforded
his countrymen, in exchange for their freedom<a id="noteref_555" name="noteref_555" href="#note_555"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">555</span></span></a>. On one
occasion, he challenged all persons of his own profession to
contend with him on the stage; and in this competition he
successively overcame every one of his rivals. By his success
in the representation of these popular entertainments, he
amassed considerable wealth, and lived with such luxury, that
he never gave a great supper without having sow’s udder at
table—a dish which was prohibited by the censors, as being
too great a luxury even for the table of patricians<a id="noteref_556" name="noteref_556" href="#note_556"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">556</span></span></a>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Nothing farther is known of his history, except that he was
still continuing to perform his Mimes with applause at the period
of the death of Laberius.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We have not the names of any of the Mimes of Publius;
nor do we precisely know their nature or subject,—all that is
preserved from them being a number of detached sentiments
or maxims, to the number of 800 or 900, seldom exceeding a
single line, but containing reflections of unrivalled force, truth,
and beauty, on all the various relations, situations, and feelings
of human life—friendship, love, fortune, pride, adversity,
avarice, generosity. Both the writers and actors of Mimes
were probably careful to have their memory stored with common-places
and precepts of morality, in order to introduce
them appropriately in their extemporaneous performances.
The maxims of Publius were interspersed through his dramas,
but being the only portion of these productions now remaining,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page333">[pg 333]</span><a name="Pg333" id="Pg333" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>they have just the appearance of thoughts or sentiments, like
those of Rochefoucauld. His Mimes must either have been
very numerous, or very thickly loaded with these moral aphorisms.
It is also surprising that they seem raised far above
the ordinary tone even of regular comedy, and appear for the
greater part to be almost stoical maxims. Seneca has remarked
that many of his eloquent verses are fitter for the
buskin than the slipper<a id="noteref_557" name="noteref_557" href="#note_557"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">557</span></span></a>. How such exalted precepts should
have been grafted on the lowest farce, and how passages,
which would hardly be <a name="corr333" id="corr333" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">appropriate</span> in the most serious sentimental
comedy, were adapted to the actions or manners of
gross and drunken buffoons, is a difficulty which could only
be solved had we fortunately received entire a larger portion
of these productions, which seem to have been peculiar to
Roman genius.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The sentiments of Publius Syrus now appear trite. They
have become familiar to mankind, and have been re-echoed
by poets and moralists from age to age. All of them are most
felicitously expressed, and few of them seem erroneous, while
at the same time they are perfectly free from the selfish or
worldly-minded wisdom of Rochefoucauld, or Lord Burleigh.

of the maxims of the Roman Mime in his writings,—expanding,
modifying, or accommodating them to the manners of his age
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page334">[pg 334]</span><a name="Pg334" id="Pg334" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and country, as best suited his purpose. One of them only,

This sentiment, which Publius had borrowed from the Greeks,
and which is supposed to have been originally one of the sayings
of Bias, has been censured by Cicero, in his beautiful
treatise <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De Amicitia</span></span>, as the bane of friendship. It would be
endless to quote the lines of the different Latin poets, particularly
Horace and Juvenal, which are nearly copied from
the maxims of Publius Syrus. Seneca, too, has availed himself
of many of his reflections, and, at the same time, does full
justice to the author from whom he has borrowed. Publius,
says he, is superior in genius both to tragic and comic writers:
Whenever he gives up the follies of the Mimes, and that language
which is directed to the crowd, he writes many things
not only above that species of composition, but worthy of the
tragic buskin<a id="noteref_558" name="noteref_558" href="#note_558"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">558</span></span></a>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Cneius Matius, also a celebrated writer of Mimes, was contemporary
with Laberius and Publius Syrus. Some writers
have confounded him with Caius Matius, who was a correspondent
of Cicero, and an intimate friend of Julius Cæsar.
Ziegler, though he distinguishes him from Cicero’s correspondent,
says, that he was the same person as the friend of Cæsar<a id="noteref_559" name="noteref_559" href="#note_559"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">559</span></span></a>.

Aulus Gellius calls Matius a very learned man, (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">homo

obsolete terms and forms of expression<a id="noteref_560" name="noteref_560" href="#note_560"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">560</span></span></a>. Like other writers
of Mimes, he indulged himself a good deal in this sort of phraseology,

highly poetical<a id="noteref_561" name="noteref_561" href="#note_561"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">561</span></span></a>.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The age of Laberius, P. Syrus, and Matius, was the most
brilliant epoch in the history of the actors of Mimes. After
that period, they relapsed into a race of impudent buffoons;
and, in the reign of Augustus, were classed, by Horace, with
mountebanks and mendicants<a id="noteref_563" name="noteref_563" href="#note_563"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">563</span></span></a>. Pantomimic actors, who did
not employ their voice, but represented everything by gesticulation
and dancing, became, under Augustus, the idols of the
multitude, the minions of the great, and the favourites of the
fair. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Mimi</span></span> were then but little patronized on the stage,
but were still admitted into convivial parties, and even the
court of the Emperors, to entertain the guests<a id="noteref_564" name="noteref_564" href="#note_564"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">564</span></span></a>, like the Histrions,
Jongleurs, or privileged fools, of the middle ages; and
they were also employed at funerals, to mimic the manners of
the deceased. Thus, the Archimimus, who represented the
character of the avaricious Vespasian, at the splendid celebration
of his obsequies, inquired what would be the cost of all
this posthumous parade; and on being told that it would
amount to ten millions of sesterces, he replied, that if they
would give him a hundred thousand, they might throw his
body into the river<a id="noteref_565" name="noteref_565" href="#note_565"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">565</span></span></a>. The audacity, however, of the Mimes
was carried still farther, as they satirized and insulted the
most ferocious Emperors during their lives, and in their own
presence. An actor, in one of these pieces which was performed
during the reign of Nero, while repeating the words
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vale pater, vale mater</span></span>,”</span> signified by his gestures the two
modes of drowning and poisoning, in which that sanguinary
fiend had attempted to destroy both his parents<a id="noteref_566" name="noteref_566" href="#note_566"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">566</span></span></a>. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Mimi</span></span> 
currently bestowed on Commodus the most opprobrious appellation<a id="noteref_567" name="noteref_567" href="#note_567"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">567</span></span></a>. 
One of their number, who performed before the enormous
Maximin, reminded the audience, that he who was too
strong for an individual, might be massacred by a multitude,
and that thus the elephant, lion, and tiger, are slain. The
tyrant perceived the sensation excited in the Theatre, but the
suggestion was veiled in a language unknown to that barbarous
and gigantic Thracian<a id="noteref_568" name="noteref_568" href="#note_568"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">568</span></span></a>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Mimes may be traced beyond the age of Constantine,
as we find the fathers of the church reprehending the immorality
and licentiousness of such exhibitions<a id="noteref_569" name="noteref_569" href="#note_569"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">569</span></span></a>. Tradition is
never so faithful as in the preservation of popular pastimes;
and accordingly, many of those which had amused the Romans
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page336">[pg 336]</span><a name="Pg336" id="Pg336" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>survived their dominion. The annual celebration of Carnival
prolonged the remembrance of them during the dark ages.
Hence, the Mimes, and the Atellane fables formerly mentioned,
became the origin of the Italian pantomimic parts introduced in
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Commedie dell’ arte</span></span>, in which a subject was assigned, and the
scenes were enumerated; but in which the dialogue was left
to the extemporary invention of the actors, who represented
buffoon characters in masks, and spoke the dialect of different
districts. <span class="tei tei-q">“As to Italy,”</span> says Warburton, in an account
given by him of the Rise and Progress of the Modern Stage,
<span class="tei tei-q">“the first rudiments of its theatre, with regard to the matter,
were profane subjects, and with regard to the form, a corruption
of ancient Mimes and Atellanes.”</span>—Zanni is one of the
names of the Harlequin in the Italian comedies; and Sannio, as
we learn from ancient writers, was a ridiculous personage,
who performed in these Latin farces, with his head shaved<a id="noteref_570" name="noteref_570" href="#note_570"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">570</span></span></a>,
his face bedaubed with soot<a id="noteref_571" name="noteref_571" href="#note_571"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">571</span></span></a>, and clothed in party-coloured
garments—a dress universally worn by the ancient Italian
peasantry during the existence of the Roman Republic<a id="noteref_572" name="noteref_572" href="#note_572"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">572</span></span></a>.
The lowest species of mimic actors were called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">planipedes</span></span>, because
they performed without sock or buskin, and generally
barefooted, whence Harlequin’s flat unsho’d feet. A passage of
Cicero, in which he speaks of the Sannio, seems almost intended
to describe the perpetual and flexible motion of the limbs,
the ludicrous gestures, and mimetic countenance of Harlequin.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Quid enim”</span> says he, <span class="tei tei-q">“potest tam ridiculum quam Sannio
esse? qui ore, vultu, imitandis motibus, voce, denique corpore
ridetur ipso<a id="noteref_573" name="noteref_573" href="#note_573"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">573</span></span></a>.”</span> Among the Italians, indeed, this character
soon degenerated into a booby and glutton, who became
the butt of his more sharp-sighted companions. In France,
Harlequin was converted into a wit,—sometimes even a moralist; 
and with us he has been transformed into an expert
magician, who astonishes by sudden changes of the scene:
But none of these was his original, or native character, which,
as we have seen, corresponded to the Sannio of the Mimes and
Atellane fables. In the year 1727, a bronze figure of high
antiquity, and of which Quadrio gives an engraving<a id="noteref_574" name="noteref_574" href="#note_574"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">574</span></span></a>, was
found at Rome; and it appears from it, that the modern Pollicinella
of Naples is a lineal descendant of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Mimus Albus</span></span> 
of the Atellanes<a id="noteref_575" name="noteref_575" href="#note_575"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">575</span></span></a>. Ficoroni, who, in his work <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Larve Sceniche</span></span>, 
compares his immense collection of Roman masks with the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page337">[pg 337]</span><a name="Pg337" id="Pg337" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>modern Italian characters, was possessed of an onyx, which represented
a Mime with a long nose and pointed cap, carrying
a bag of money in one hand, and two brass balls in the other,
which he sounded, as is supposed, like castanets when he danced.
These appendages correspond to the attributes which
distinguished the Italian dancer of Catana, known by the name
of Giangorgolo. Another onyx exhibits a figure resembling
that of Pantalone. It is also evident from the Antiques collected
by Ficoroni, that the Roman <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Mimi</span></span> were fond of representing
caricatures of foreign nations, as we find among these
ancient figures the attires of the oriental nations, and the garb
of old Gaul—a species of exhibition in which the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Commedia
dell’ arte</span></span> also particularly delighted.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Commedie dell’ arte</span></span> were brought to the highest
pitch of comic and grotesque perfection by Ruzzante, an Italian
dramatist, who both wrote and performed a number of
them about the middle of the sixteenth century, and who, in
addition to Zany and Pollicinella, peopled the stage with a
new and enlivening crowd of mimetic characters. There appears
to be something so congenial to the Italian taste in
these exhibitions, that they long maintained their ground
against the regular dramas, produced by the numerous successors
of Trissino and Bibbiena, and kept supreme possession
of the Italian stage, till at length Goldoni, by introducing
beauties which were incongruous with the ancient masks, gradually
refined the taste of his audience, made them ashamed
of their former favourites, and then, in some of his pieces,
ventured to exclude from the stage the whole grotesque and
gesticulating family of Harlequin.

Having said so much (and, I fear, too much) of the Mimes,
and other departments of the Roman drama, it would not be
suitable to conclude without some notice, I. of the mechanical
construction of the theatre where the dramatic entertainments
were produced; and, II. of the actors’ declamation, as also of
the masks and other attributes of the characters which were
chiefly represented.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I. Such was the severity of the ancient republican law,
that it permitted no places of amusement, except the circus,
where games were specially privileged from having been
instituted by Romulus, and exhibited in honour of the gods.
Satiric and dramatic representations, however, as we have
seen, gradually became popular; and, at length, so increased
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page338">[pg 338]</span><a name="Pg338" id="Pg338" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>in number and importance, that a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Theatre</span></span> was required for
their performance.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The subject of the construction of the Roman theatre is
attended with difficulty and confusion. While there are still
considerable remains of amphitheatres, scarcely any ruins or
vestiges of theatres exist. The writings of the ancients throw
little light on the topic; and there is much contradiction, or
at least apparent inconsistency, in what has been written, in
consequence of the alterations which took place in the construction
of theatres in the progress of time.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Those stages, which were erected in the earliest periods of
the Roman republic, for the exhibitions of dancers and histrions,
were probably set up according to the Etruscan mode,
in places covered with boughs of trees, (Nemorosa palatia,)
in tents or booths, or, at best, in temporary and moveable
buildings—perhaps not much superior in dignity or accommodation
to the cart of Thespis.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But, though the Etruscan histrions probably constructed
the stage on which they were to perform, according to the
fashion of their own country, the Greek was the model of the
regular Roman theatre, as much as the pieces of Euripides
and Menander were the prototypes of the Latin tragedies and
comedies. The remains of a playhouse believed to be Etruscan,
were discovered at Adria about the middle of the seventeenth
century. But there was a wider difference between it
and the Roman theatre, than between the Roman and the
Greek. The Greeks had a large orchestra, and a very limited
stage—the Romans, a confined orchestra, and extensive stage;
while in the Adrian theatre, the orchestra was larger even
than in the Greek<a id="noteref_576" name="noteref_576" href="#note_576"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">576</span></span></a>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The first regular theatre at Rome was that constructed for
Livius Andronicus on the Aventine Hill. This building, however,
was but temporary, and probably existed no longer than
the distinguished dramatist and actor for whose accommodation
it was erected. In the year 575, M. Æmilius Lepidus got
a theatre constructed adjacent to the temple of Apollo<a id="noteref_577" name="noteref_577" href="#note_577"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">577</span></span></a>; but
it also was one of those occasional buildings, which were
removed after the series of dramatic exhibitions for which
they had been intended were concluded. A short while before
the commencement of the third Punic war, a playhouse, which
the censors were fitting up with seats for the convenience of
the spectators, was thrown down by a decree of the senate,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page339">[pg 339]</span><a name="Pg339" id="Pg339" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>as prejudicial to public morals; and the people continued for
some time longer to view the representations standing, as
formerly<a id="noteref_578" name="noteref_578" href="#note_578"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">578</span></span></a>. At length, M. Æmilius Scaurus built a theatre
capable of containing 80,000 spectators, and provided with
every possible accommodation for the public. It was also
adorned with amazing magnificence, and at almost incredible
expense. Its stage had three lofts or stories, rising above each
other, and supported by 360 marble columns. The lowest
floor was of marble—the second was incrusted with glass;
and the third was formed of gilded boards or planks. The
pillars were thirty-eight feet in height: and between them
were placed bronze statues and images, to the number of not
fewer than 3000. There was besides an immense superfluity
of rich hangings of cloth of gold; and painted tablets, the
most exquisite that could be procured, were disposed all
around the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pulpitum</span></span> and scenes<a id="noteref_579" name="noteref_579" href="#note_579"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">579</span></span></a>.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Curio, being unable to rival such profuse and costly decoration,
distinguished himself by a new invention, which he
introduced at the funeral entertainments given by him in honour
of his father’s memory. He constructed two large edifices of
wood adjacent to each other, and suspended on hinges so
contrived that the buildings could be united at their centre or
separated, in such a manner as to form a theatre or amphitheatre,
according to the nature of the exhibition. In both
these fabrics he made stage plays be acted in the early part
of the day—the semicircles being placed back to back, so
that the declamation, music, and applauses, in the one, did
not reach the other; and then, having wheeled them round in
the afternoon, so that, by completing the circle, they formed
an amphitheatre, he exhibited combats of gladiators<a id="noteref_580" name="noteref_580" href="#note_580"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">580</span></span></a>. All
these changes were performed without displacing the spectators,
who seem to have fearlessly trusted themselves to the
strength of the machinery, and skill of the artist.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The theatres of Scaurus and Curio, though they far surpassed
in extent and sumptuous decoration all the permanent
theatres of modern times: yet, being built of wood, and being
only destined for a certain number of representations during
certain games or festivals, were demolished when these were
concluded. The whole furnishings and costly materials of
the theatre of Scaurus were immediately removed to his private
villa, where they were burned, it is said, by his servants,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page340">[pg 340]</span><a name="Pg340" id="Pg340" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>in a transport of indignation at the extravagant profusion of
their master<a id="noteref_581" name="noteref_581" href="#note_581"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">581</span></span></a>.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Pompey was the first person who erected a permanent
theatre of stone. After the termination of the Mithridatic
war, he made a coasting voyage along the shores and islands
of Greece. In the whole of his progress he showed the attention
of a liberal and cultivated mind to monuments of art.
The theatre of Mitylene particularly pleased him, both in its
outward form, and interior construction. He carried away
with him a model of this building, that he might erect at
Rome a theatre similar to it<a id="noteref_582" name="noteref_582" href="#note_582"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">582</span></span></a>, but on a larger scale. The
edifice which he built on the plan of this theatre, after his
return to Rome, was situated in the field of Flora, near the
temple of Venus Victrix, and held just one half of the number
of spectators which the playhouse of Scaurus contained<a id="noteref_583" name="noteref_583" href="#note_583"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">583</span></span></a>. It
was completed during Pompey’s second consulship, in the
year 698. On the day on which it was opened, Æsopus, the
great tragic actor, appeared for the last time in one of his
favourite characters, but his strength and voice failed him,
and he was unable to finish the part.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The construction of this theatre was speedily followed by
the erection of others. But all the Roman theatres which
were built towards the close of the republic, and commencement
of the empire, were formed, in most respects, on the
model of the Greek theatre, both in their external plan and
interior arrangement. They were oblong semicircular buildings,
forming the half of an amphitheatre; and were thus
rounded at one end, and terminated on the other by a long
straight line. The interior was divided into three parts—1.
The place for the spectators; 2. The orchestra; and, 3. The
stage<a id="noteref_584" name="noteref_584" href="#note_584"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">584</span></span></a>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. The universal passion of the Roman people for all sorts
of exhibitions, rendered the places from which they were to
view them a matter of competition and importance. Originally
there were no seats in the theatres, and the senators
stood promiscuously with the people; yet, such in those days
was the reverence felt by the plebeians for their dignified
superiors, that, notwithstanding their rage for spectacles,
they never pushed before a senator<a id="noteref_585" name="noteref_585" href="#note_585"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">585</span></span></a>. It was in the year 559,
during the consulship of the elder Scipio Africanus with
Sempronius Longus, that the former carried a law, by which
separate places were assigned to the senators<a id="noteref_586" name="noteref_586" href="#note_586"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">586</span></span></a>. 
This regu<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page341">[pg 341]</span><a name="Pg341" id="Pg341" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>lation was renewed from time to time, as circumstances of
political confusion removed the line of distinction which had
been drawn. Scipio lost much of his popularity by this aristocratic
innovation, and is said to have severely repented of
the share he had taken in it<a id="noteref_587" name="noteref_587" href="#note_587"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">587</span></span></a>. By the law of Scipio, part of
the orchestra, (which, in the Greek theatre, was occupied by
the chorus,) was appropriated to the senators. The knights
and plebeians, however, continued to sit promiscuously for
more than 100 years longer; but at length, in 685, a regulation
of the tribune, Roscius Otho, allotted to the knights, tribunes,
and persons of a certain <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">census</span></span>, fourteen rows of circular
benches immediately behind the orchestra. This was a still more
unpopular measure than that introduced by the edict of Africanus.
Otho, during the consulship of Cicero, having entered
the theatre, was hissed by the multitude, while Roscius was
acting one of his principal parts; but Cicero presently called
them out to the temple of Bellona, where he delivered a
harangue, which appeased their fury and reconciled them to
the tribune<a id="noteref_588" name="noteref_588" href="#note_588"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">588</span></span></a>. Henceforth the senators held undisputed possession
of the orchestra; and the knights, with the better
classes, retained the fourteen rows of seats immediately surrounding
it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The seats for the senators, arranged in the orchestra, were
straight benches, placed at equal distances from each other,
and were not fixed<a id="noteref_589" name="noteref_589" href="#note_589"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">589</span></span></a>. The other benches, which were assigned
to the knights and people, were semicircularly disposed
around the circumference of the theatre, and spread from the
orchestra to the rounded end of the building The extremities
of the seats joined the orchestra, and they were carried
one above another, sloping, till they reached the remotest
part, and ascended almost to the ceiling. Thus the benches
which were lowest and most contiguous to the orchestra,
described a smaller circumference than those which spread
more towards the outer walls of the theatre<a id="noteref_590" name="noteref_590" href="#note_590"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">590</span></span></a>. Over the
higher tier of seats a portico was constructed, the roof of
which ranged with the loftiest part of the scene, in order that
the voice expanding equally, might be carried to the uppermost
seats, and thence to the top of the building<a id="noteref_591" name="noteref_591" href="#note_591"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">591</span></span></a>. The
benches, which were gently raised above each other, were
separated into three sets or tiers: each tier, at least in most
theatres, consisting of seven benches. According to some
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page342">[pg 342]</span><a name="Pg342" id="Pg342" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>writers, the separation of these tiers was a passage, or gallery,
which went quite round them for facility of communication;
according to others, it was a belt, or precinction, which was
twice the height, and twice the breadth of the seats<a id="noteref_592" name="noteref_592" href="#note_592"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">592</span></span></a>. It
would appear, however, from a passage in Vitruvius, that
both a raised belt, and a gallery or corridore, surrounded
each tier of seats<a id="noteref_593" name="noteref_593" href="#note_593"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">593</span></span></a>. One of the precinctions formed the
division between the places of the knights and those of the
people<a id="noteref_594" name="noteref_594" href="#note_594"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">594</span></span></a>. In a different and angular direction, the tiers and
ranges of seats were separated by stairs, making so many
lines in the circumference of the seats, and leading from
the orchestra to the doors of the theatre. The benches
were cut by the stairs into the form of wedges. The steps of
the stairs were always a little lower than the seats; but the
number of stairs varied in different theatres. Pompey’s
theatre had fifteen, that of Marcellus only seven<a id="noteref_595" name="noteref_595" href="#note_595"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">595</span></span></a>. As luxury
increased at Rome, these stairs were bedewed with streams of
fragrant water, for the purposes of coolness and refreshment.
At the top of each flight of steps were doors called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vomitoria</span></span>, 
which gave egress from the theatre, and communicated
directly with the external stair-cases<a id="noteref_596" name="noteref_596" href="#note_596"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">596</span></span></a>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the ancient temporary Roman theatres, the body of the
building, or place where the spectators sat, was open at top
to receive the light. But Quintus Catulus, during the entertainments
exhibited at his dedication of the Capitol, introduced
the luxury of canvass, which was drawn partially or
completely over the theatre at pleasure<a id="noteref_597" name="noteref_597" href="#note_597"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">597</span></span></a>. This curtain was
at first of simple unornamented <a name="corr342" id="corr342" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">wool</span>, and was merely used as
a screen from the sun, or a protection from rain; but, in
process of time, silken hangings of glossy texture and splendid
hues waved from the roof, flinging their gorgeous tints on the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">proscenium</span></span> and spectators:—

2. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Orchestra</span></span> was a considerable space in the centre
of the theatre, part of which was allotted for the seats of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page343">[pg 343]</span><a name="Pg343" id="Pg343" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>senators. The remainder was occupied by those who played
upon musical instruments, whose office it was, in the performance
both of tragedies and comedies, to give to the
actors and audience the tone of feeling which the dramatic
parts demanded. In tragedies, the music invariably accompanied
the Chorus. It was not, however, confined to the
Chorus; but appears to have been also in the monologues,
and perhaps in some of the most impassioned parts of the dialogue; 
for Cicero tells of Roscius, that he said, when he grew
older, he would make the music play slower, that he might
the more easily keep up with it<a id="noteref_599" name="noteref_599" href="#note_599"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">599</span></span></a>. I do not, however, believe,
that comedy was a musical performance throughout: Mr Hawkins,
after quoting a number of authorities to this purpose,
concludes, <span class="tei tei-q">“that comedy had no music but between the acts,
except, perhaps, occasionally in the case of marriages and
sacrifices, if any such were represented on the stage<a id="noteref_600" name="noteref_600" href="#note_600"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">600</span></span></a>.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Every play had its own musical prelude, which distinguished
it from others, and from which many of the audience at once
knew what piece was about to be performed<a id="noteref_601" name="noteref_601" href="#note_601"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">601</span></span></a>. The chief
musical instruments employed in the theatre were the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">tibiæ</span></span>, 
or flutes, with which the comedies of Terence are believed to
have been represented. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Andria</span></span> is said to have been
acted, <span class="tei tei-q">“Tibiis paribus, dextris et sinistris;”</span>—the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Eunuch</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">“Tibiis
duabus dextris;”</span>—the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Heautontimorumenos</span></span>, on its first
appearance, <span class="tei tei-q">“Tibiis imparibus;”</span> on its second, <span class="tei tei-q">“Duabus dextris;”</span>—the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Adelphi</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">“Tibiis sarranis;”</span>—the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hecyra</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">“Tibiis
paribus,”</span>—and the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phormio</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">“Tibiis imparibus.”</span> It thus
appears, that the theatrical flutes were classed as <span class="tei tei-q">“dextræ et
sinistræ,”</span> and also as <span class="tei tei-q">“pares et impares,”</span> and that there were
likewise <span class="tei tei-q">“Tibiæ Serranæ,”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“Sarranæ,”</span> to which, it is believed,
the Phrygiæ were opposed. There has been much
dispute, however, as to what constituted the distinction between
these different sets of pipes. Scaliger thinks, that the
<span class="tei tei-q">“Tibiæ dextræ et sinistræ”</span> were formed by cutting the reed
into two parts: that portion which was next to the root making
the left, and that next to the top the right flute.—whence
the notes of the former were more grave, and those of the
latter more acute<a id="noteref_602" name="noteref_602" href="#note_602"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">602</span></span></a>. Mad. Dacier, however, is of opinion, that
flutes were denominated right and left from the valves, in
playing, being stopped with the right or left hand. There is
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page344">[pg 344]</span><a name="Pg344" id="Pg344" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>still more difficulty with regard to the <span class="tei tei-q">“Tibiæ pares et impares.”</span>
Some persons conjecture, that the Tibiæ pares were
a set of two or more pipes of the same pitch in the musical
scale, and Impares such as did not agree in pitch<a id="noteref_603" name="noteref_603" href="#note_603"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">603</span></span></a>. The
opinion, that flutes were called Pares when they had an even,
and Impares when an odd number of valves, is not inconsistent
with this notion; nor with that adopted by Dempster<a id="noteref_604" name="noteref_604" href="#note_604"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">604</span></span></a>, that
the difference depended on their being equal or unequal distances
between the valves. It may be also reconciled with
the idea of Salmasius, that when the same set of flutes were
employed, as two right or two left, a play was said to be acted
Tibiis paribus; and, when one or more right with one or more
left were used, it was announced as performed Tibiis imparibus.
This idea, however, of Salmasius, is inconsistent with
what is said as to the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Andria</span></span> being acted with equal flutes
right and left; unless, indeed, we suppose, with Mad. Dacier,
that this is to be understood of different representations, and
that the flutes were of the same description at each performance,
but were sometimes a set of right, and at other times a
set of left flutes.

As to the Tibiæ Serranæ, some have supposed that they
were so called from Serra, since they produced the sharp grating
sound occasioned by a saw<a id="noteref_605" name="noteref_605" href="#note_605"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">605</span></span></a>; some, that they were denominated
Sarranæ from Sarra, a city in Phœnicia, where
such flutes are believed to have been invented<a id="noteref_606" name="noteref_606" href="#note_606"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">606</span></span></a>; and others,
that they derived their name from Sero to lock; because in
these flutes, there were valves or stops which opened and shut
alternately<a id="noteref_607" name="noteref_607" href="#note_607"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">607</span></span></a>. It is only farther known, that the Tibiæ Serranæ
belonged to the class called Pares, and the Phrygiæ, to
which they were opposed, to that styled Impares.

All flutes, of whatever denomination, were <a name="corr344" id="corr344" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">extremely</span> simple
in the commencement of the dramatic art at Rome. Their
form was plain, and they had but few notes. In progress of
time, however, they became more complex, and louder in
their tones<a id="noteref_608" name="noteref_608" href="#note_608"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">608</span></span></a>.

Several chorded instruments were also used in the orchestra,
as the lyre and harp, and in later times an hydraulic organ
was introduced. This instrument, which is described in the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Organon</span></span> of Pub. Optatianus, emitted a sound which was produced
from air created by the concussion of water. Cornelius
Severus, in his poem of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ætna</span></span>, alludes to it, under the

3. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Stage</span></span>. The front area of the stage was a little elevated
above that part of the orchestra where the musicians
were placed, and was called the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Proscenium</span></span>. On the proscenium
a wooden platform, termed the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pulpitum</span></span>, was raised to
the height of five feet<a id="noteref_610" name="noteref_610" href="#note_610"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">610</span></span></a>. This the actors ascended to perform
their characters; and here all the dramatic representations of
the Romans were exhibited<a id="noteref_611" name="noteref_611" href="#note_611"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">611</span></span></a>, except the Mimes, which were
acted on the lower floor of the proscenium. Certain architectural
proportions were assigned to all these different parts of
the theatre.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The whole space or area behind the pulpitum was called
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Scena</span></span>, because the scenery appropriate to the piece was
there exhibited. <span class="tei tei-q">“The three varieties of scenes,”</span> says Vitruvius,
<span class="tei tei-q">“are termed tragic, comic, and satyric, each of which
has a style of decoration peculiar to itself. In the tragic
scene columns are represented, with statues, and other embellishments
suitable to palaces and public buildings. The
comic scene represents the houses of individuals, with their
balconies and windows arranged in imitation of private dwellings.
The satyric is adorned with groves, dens, and mountains,
and other rural objects.”</span> The rigid adherence of the
ancients to the unity of place, rendered unnecessary that frequent
shifting of scenes which is required in our dramas.
When the side scenes were changed, the frames, or painted
planks, were turned by machinery, and the scene was then
called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">versatilis</span></span>, or revolving: When it was withdrawn altogether,
and another brought forward, it was called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ductilis</span></span>, or,
sliding. There were also trapdoors in the floor of this part of
the theatre, by which ghosts and the Furies ascended when
their presence was required; and machines were disposed
above the scene, as also at its sides, by which gods and other
superior beings were suddenly brought upon the stage.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At the bottom of the scene, or end most remote from the
spectators, there was a curtain of painted canvass, which
was first used after the tapestry of Attalus had been brought
to Rome<a id="noteref_612" name="noteref_612" href="#note_612"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">612</span></span></a>. It was dropped when the play began, remained
down during the performance, and was drawn up when the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page346">[pg 346]</span><a name="Pg346" id="Pg346" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>representation concluded. This was certainly the case during
the existence of the republic; but I imagine that an alteration
took place in the time of the emperors, and that the
curtain, being brought more forward on the scene, was then,
as with us, raised at the commencement, and dropped at the
end of the piece:—

That part of the theatre which comprehended the stage and
scene was originally covered with branches of trees, which
served both for shelter and ornament. It was afterwards shut
in with planks, which were painted for the first time in the
year 654. About the same period the scene was enriched
with gold and silver hangings, and the proscenium was decorated
with columns, statues, and altars to the god in whose
honour, or at whose festival, the stage plays were represented.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
II. In turning our attention to the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">actors</span></span> who appeared on
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pulpitum</span></span> of the Roman stage, the point which first attracts
our notice is that supposed separation of the dramatic labour,
by which one performer gesticulated while the other declaimed.
This division, however, did not take place at all in comedy,
or in the ordinary dialogue (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Diverbia</span></span>) of tragedy; as is
evinced by various passages in the Latin authors, which show
that Æsopus, the chief tragic actor, and Roscius, the celebrated
comedian, both gesticulated and declaimed. Cicero informs
us, that Æsopus was hissed if he was in the least degree
hoarse<a id="noteref_614" name="noteref_614" href="#note_614"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">614</span></span></a>; and he also mentions one remarkable occasion, on
which, having returned to the stage after he had long retired
from it, his voice suddenly failed him just as he commenced
an adjuration in the part he represented<a id="noteref_615" name="noteref_615" href="#note_615"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">615</span></span></a>. This evinces
that Æsopus declaimed; and the same author affords us proof
that he gesticulated: For, in the treatise <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De Divinatione</span></span>, he
introduces his brother Quintus, declaring, that he had himself
witnessed in Æsopus such animation of countenance, and
vehemence of gesture, that he seemed carried beside himself
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page347">[pg 347]</span><a name="Pg347" id="Pg347" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>by some irresistible power<a id="noteref_616" name="noteref_616" href="#note_616"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">616</span></span></a>. Roscius, indeed, is chiefly talked
of for the gracefulness of his gestures<a id="noteref_617" name="noteref_617" href="#note_617"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">617</span></span></a>, but there are also passages
which refer to the modulation of his voice<a id="noteref_618" name="noteref_618" href="#note_618"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">618</span></span></a>. It may
perhaps, however, be said, that the above citations only prove
that the same actor gesticulated in some characters, and declaimed
in others; it seems, however, much more probable
that Æsopus went through the whole dramatic part, than that
he appeared in some plays merely as a gesticulating, and in
others as a declaiming, performer.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There was thus no division in the ordinary dialogue, or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">diverbium</span></span>,
as it was called, and it was employed only in the
monologues, and those parts of high excitement and pathos,
which were declaimed somewhat in the tone of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">recitativo</span></span> in
an Italian opera, and were called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cantica</span></span>, from being accompanied
either by the flutes or by instrumental music. That
one actor should have recited, and another performed the corresponding
gestures in the scenes of a tragedy, and that, too, in
parts of the highest excitement, and in which theatric illusion
should have been rendered most complete, certainly appears the
most incongruous and inexplicable circumstance in the history
of the Roman Drama. This division did not exist on the
Greek stage, but it commenced at Rome as early as the time
of Livius Andronicus, who, being <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">encored</span></span>, as we call it, in his
monologues, introduced a slave, who declaimed to the sound
of the flute, while he himself executed the corresponding
gesticulations<a id="noteref_619" name="noteref_619" href="#note_619"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">619</span></span></a>. To us nothing can seem at first view more
ridiculous, and more injurious to theatric illusion, than one
person going through a dumb show or pantomime, while another,
who must have appeared a supernumerary on the pulpitum,
recited, with his arms across, the corresponding verses,
in tones of the utmost vehemence and pathos<a id="noteref_620" name="noteref_620" href="#note_620"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">620</span></span></a>. It must,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page348">[pg 348]</span><a name="Pg348" id="Pg348" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>however, be recollected, that the Roman theatres were larger
and worse lighted than ours; that the mask prevented even the
nearest spectators from perceiving the least motion of the lips,
and they thus heard only the words without knowing whether
they proceeded from him who recited or gestured; and, finally,
that these actors were so well trained, that they agreed precisely
in their respective parts. We are informed by Cicero,
that a comedian who made a movement out of time was as
much hissed as one who mistook the pronunciation of a word
or quantity of a syllable in a verse<a id="noteref_621" name="noteref_621" href="#note_621"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">621</span></span></a>. Seneca says, that it is
surprising to see the attitudes of eminent comedians on the
stage overtake and keep pace with speech, notwithstanding
the velocity of the tongue<a id="noteref_622" name="noteref_622" href="#note_622"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">622</span></span></a>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
So much importance was attached to the art of dramatic
gesticulation, that it was taught in the schools; and there were
instituted motions as well as natural. These artificial gestures,
however, of arbitrary signification, were chiefly employed in
pantomime, where speech not being admitted, more action
was required to make the piece intelligible: And it appears
from Quintilian, that comedians who acted with due decorum,
never, or but very rarely, made use of instituted signs in their
gesticulation<a id="noteref_623" name="noteref_623" href="#note_623"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">623</span></span></a>. The movements suited to theatrical declamation
were subdivided into three different sorts. The first,
called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Emmelia</span></span>, was adapted to tragic declamation; the
second, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cordax</span></span>, was fitted to comedies; and the third, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sicinnis</span></span>,
was proper to satiric pieces, as the Mimes and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Exodia</span></span><a id="noteref_624" name="noteref_624" href="#note_624"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">624</span></span></a>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The recitation was also accounted of high importance, so
that the player who articulated took prodigious pains to improve
his voice, and an almost whimsical care to preserve it<a id="noteref_625" name="noteref_625" href="#note_625"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">625</span></span></a>.
Nearly a third part of Dubos’ once celebrated work on Poetry
and Painting, is occupied with the theatric declamation of
the Roman actors. The art of framing the declamation of
dramatic pieces was, he informs us, the object of a particular
study, and indeed profession, at Rome. It was composed and
signified in notes, placed over each verse of the play, to direct
the tones and inflection of voice which were to be observed
in recitation. There were a certain number of accents in the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page349">[pg 349]</span><a name="Pg349" id="Pg349" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Latin language, and the composer of a declamation marked
each syllable requiring to be accented, the grave or the acute
accent which properly belonged to it, while on the remaining
syllables, he noted, by means of conventional marks, a tone
conformable to the tenor of the discourse. The declamation
was thus not a musical song, but a recitation subject to the
direction of a noted melody. Tragic declamation was graver
and more harmonious than comic, but even the comic was more
musical and varied than the pronunciation used in ordinary
conversation<a id="noteref_626" name="noteref_626" href="#note_626"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">626</span></span></a>. This system, it might be supposed, would
have deprived the actors of much natural fire and enthusiasm,
from the constraint to which they were thus subjected; but
the whole dramatic system of the ancients was more artificial
than ours, and something determinate and previously arranged,
as to quantities and pauses, was perhaps essential to enable
the gesticulating actor to move in proper concert with the
reciter. The whole system, however, of noted declamation,
is denied by Duclos and Racine, who think it impossible that
accentuated tones of passion could be devised or employed<a id="noteref_627" name="noteref_627" href="#note_627"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">627</span></span></a>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Both the actor who declaimed, and he who gesticulated,
wore <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">masks</span></span>; and, before concluding the subject of the Roman
theatre, it may not be improper to say a few words concerning
this singular dramatic contrivance, as also concerning the
attire of the performers.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From the opportunity which they so readily afforded, of
personally satirizing individuals, by representing a caricatured
resemblance of their features, masks were first used in the old
Greek comedy, which assumed the liberty of characterizing
living citizens of Athens. It is most probable, however, that
the hint of dramatic masks was given to the Romans by the
Etruscans<a id="noteref_628" name="noteref_628" href="#note_628"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">628</span></span></a>. That they were employed by the histrions of
that latter nation, can admit of no doubt. The actors represented
on the Etruscan vases are all masked, and have caps
on their heads<a id="noteref_629" name="noteref_629" href="#note_629"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">629</span></span></a>. We also know, that in some of the satirical
exhibitions of the ancient Italians, they wore masks made of
wood:

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Originally, and in the time of L. Andronicus, the actors on
the Roman stage used only caps or beavers<a id="noteref_631" name="noteref_631" href="#note_631"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">631</span></span></a>, and their faces
were daubed and disguised with the lees of wine, as at the
commencement of the dramatic art in Greece. The increased
size, however, of the theatres, and consequent distance of the
spectators from the stage, at length compelled the Roman
players to borrow from art the expression of those passions
which could no longer be distinguished on the living countenance
of the actor.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Most of the Roman masks covered not merely the face, but
the greater part of the head<a id="noteref_632" name="noteref_632" href="#note_632"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">632</span></span></a>, so that the beard and hair were
delineated, as well as the features. This indeed is implied in
one of the fables of Phædrus, where a fox, after having
examined a tragic mask, which he found lying in his way,
exclaims, <span class="tei tei-q">“What a vast shape without brains<a id="noteref_633" name="noteref_633" href="#note_633"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">633</span></span></a>!”</span>—An observation
obviously absurd, if applied to a mere vizard for the face,
which was not made, and could not have been expected, to
contain any brains. Addison, in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Travels in Italy</span></span>, mentions,
that, in that country, he had seen statues of actors, with
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">larva</span></span> or mask. One of these was not merely a vizard for
the face; it had false hair, and came over the whole head like
an helmet. He also mentions, however, that he has seen
figures of Thalia, sometimes with an entire head-piece in her
hand, and a friz running round the edges of the face; but at
others, with a mask merely for the countenance, like the
modern vizards of a masquerade.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The masks of the regular theatre were made of chalk, or
pipe-clay, or terra cotta. A few were of metal, but these
were chiefly the masks of the Mimes. The chalk or clay
masks were so transparent and artfully prepared, that the play
of the muscles could be seen through them; and it appears
that an opening was frequently left for the eyes, since Cicero
informs us expressly, that in parts of high pathos or indignation,
the actor’s eyes were often observed to sparkle under the
vizard<a id="noteref_634" name="noteref_634" href="#note_634"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">634</span></span></a>. From a vast collection of Roman masks engraved in
the work of Ficoroni, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De Larvis Scenicis</span></span>, it appears that most
of them represented features considerably distorted, and
enlarged beyond the natural proportions. A wide and gaping
mouth is one of their chief characteristics. The mask being
in a great measure contrived to prevent the dispersion of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page351">[pg 351]</span><a name="Pg351" id="Pg351" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>voice, the mouth was so formed, and was so incrusted with
metal, as to have somewhat the effect of a speaking-trumpet—hence
the Romans gave the name of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">persona</span></span> to masks, because
they rendered the articulation of those who wore them more
distinct and sonorous<a id="noteref_635" name="noteref_635" href="#note_635"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">635</span></span></a>. There are, however, a few figures in
the work of Ficoroni, carrying in their hands masks which are
not unnaturally distorted, and which have, in several instances,
a resemblance to the actor who holds them. M. Boindin, on
the authority of a passage in Lucian’s <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dialogue on Dancing</span></span>, 
thinks that these less hideous masks were employed by dancers,
or pantomimic actors, who, as they did not speak, had no
occasion for the distended mouth<a id="noteref_636" name="noteref_636" href="#note_636"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">636</span></span></a>.

The different characters who chiefly appeared on the Roman
stage—the father, the lover, the parasite, the pander, and
the courtezan, were distinguished by their <a name="corr351" id="corr351" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">appropriate</span> masks.
A particular physiognomy was considered as so essential to
each character, that it was thought, that without a proper
mask, a complete knowledge of the personage could not be
communicated. <span class="tei tei-q">“In tragedies,”</span> says Quintilian, <span class="tei tei-q">“Niobe appears
with a sorrowful countenance—and Medea announces
her character by the fierce expression of her physiognomy—stern 
courage is painted on the mask of Hercules, while that
of Ajax proclaims his transport and phrensy. In comedies,
the masks of slaves, pimps, and parasites—peasants, soldiers,
old women, courtezans, and female slaves, have each their
particular character<a id="noteref_639" name="noteref_639" href="#note_639"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">639</span></span></a>.”</span> Julius Pollux, in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Onomasticon</span></span>, 
has given a minute description of the mask appropriate to
every dramatic character<a id="noteref_640" name="noteref_640" href="#note_640"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">640</span></span></a>. His work, however, was written
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page352">[pg 352]</span><a name="Pg352" id="Pg352" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>in the reign of the Emperor Commodus, and his observations
are chiefly formed on the practice of the Greek theatre, so
that there may have been some difference between the various
masks he describes, and those of the Roman stage, towards
the end of the republic. The matron, virgin, and courtezan,
he informs us, were particularly distinguished from each other
by the manner in which their hair was arranged and braided.
The mask of the parasite had brown and curled hair: That
of the braggart captain had black hair, and a swarthy complexion<a id="noteref_641" name="noteref_641" href="#note_641"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">641</span></span></a>;
and it farther appears from the engravings of masks
in Ficoroni, that he had a distended or inflated countenance.
The masks, likewise, distinguished the severe from the indulgent
father—the Micio from the Demea—and the sober youth
from the debauched rake<a id="noteref_642" name="noteref_642" href="#note_642"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">642</span></span></a>. If, in the course of the comedy,
the father was to be sometimes pleased, but sometimes incensed,
one of the brows of his vizard was knit, and the other
smooth; and the actor was always careful, during the course
of the representation, to turn to the spectators, along with the
change of passion, the profile which expressed the feeling
predominant at the time<a id="noteref_643" name="noteref_643" href="#note_643"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">643</span></span></a>. Julius Pollux has also described
the dresses suited to each character: The youth was clad in
purple, the parasite in black, slaves in white, the pander in
party-coloured garments, and the courtezan in flowing yellow
robes<a id="noteref_644" name="noteref_644" href="#note_644"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">644</span></span></a>.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It would introduce too long discussion, were I to enter on
the much-agitated question concerning the advantages and
disadvantages of masks in theatric representations. The latter
are almost too apparent to be enlarged on or recapitulated.
It is obvious to remark, that though masks might do very well
for a Satyr and Cyclops, who have no resemblance to human
features, they are totally unsuitable for a flatterer, a miser, or
the like characters, which abound in our own species, in whom
the expression of countenance is more agreeable even than
the action, and forms a considerable part of the histrionic art.
Could we suppose that a vizard represented ever so naturally
the general humour of a character, it can never be assimilated
with the variety of passions incident to each person, in the
whole course of a play. The grimace may be proper on some
occasions, but it is too fixed and steady to agree with all. In
consequence, however, of the great size of the ancient theatres,
there was not so much lost by the concealment of the living
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page353">[pg 353]</span><a name="Pg353" id="Pg353" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>countenance, as we are apt at first to suppose. It was impossible
that those alterations of visage, which are hidden by a
mask, could have been distinctly perceived by one-tenth of
the 40,000 spectators of a Roman play. The feelings portrayed
in the ancient drama were neither so tender nor versatile
as those in modern plays, and the actors did not require
the same flexibility of features—there were fewer flashes of
joy in sorrow, fewer gleams of benignity in hatred. Hercules,
the Satyrs, the Cyclops, and other characters of superhuman
strength or deformity, were more frequently introduced on the
ancient than the modern stage, and, by aid of the mask, were
more easily invested with their appropriate force or ugliness.
By means, too, of these masks, the dramatists introduced foreign
nations on the stage with their own peculiar physiognomy,
and among others, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rufi persona Batavi</span></span>. Their use, besides,
prevented the frequenters of the theatre from seeing an
actor, far advanced in years, play the part of a young lover,
since the vizard, under which the performer appeared, was always,
to that extent at least, agreeable to the character he
assumed. In addition to all this, by concealing the mouth it
prevented the spectators from observing whence the sound
issued, and thus palliated the absurdity of one actor declaiming,
and the other beating time, as it were by gestures. Finally,
as the tragic actor was elevated by his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">cothurnus</span></span>, or
buskin, above the ordinary stature of man, it became necessary,
in order to preserve the due proportions of the human
form, that his countenance also should be enlarged to corresponding
dimensions.

I shall here close the first Volume of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">History of Roman
Literature</span></span>, in which I have treated of the Origin of the
Romans—the Progress of their Language, and the different
Poets by whom their Literature was illustrated, till the era of
Augustus. At that period Virgil beautifully acknowledges
the superiority of the Greeks in statuary, oratory, and science;
but he might, with equal justice, (and the avowal would have
come from him with peculiar propriety,) have confessed that
the Muses loved better to haunt Pindus and Parnassus, than
Soracte or the Alban Hill. From the days of Ennius downwards,
the literature and poetry of the Romans was, with exception,
perhaps, of satire, and some dramatic entertainments
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page354">[pg 354]</span><a name="Pg354" id="Pg354" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of a satiric description, wholly Greek—consisting merely of
imitations, and, in some instances, almost of translations from
that language. We may compare it to a tree transplanted in
full growth to an inferior soil or climate, and which, though
still venerable or beautiful, loses much of its verdure and
freshness, sends forth no new shoots, is preserved alive with
difficulty, and, if for a short time neglected, shrivels and decays.

        Ed. Luca, 1767. It was on these Eugubian tables that, in modern times, the
        alphabet of the Etruscan language was first found. At the earliest attempt it was
        very imperfect and contradictory; Maffei maintaining that these tables were in Hebrew,
        and Gori that they were in Greek characters; but at length in 1732, M. Bourguet,
        a Frenchman, by comparing the tables in the Roman with those in the Etruscan
        character, found that the former was a compendium of the latter, and that many
        words in the one corresponded with words in the other. Having got this key, he
        was enabled, by comparing word with word, and letter with letter, to form an alphabet,
        which, though not perfect, was much more complete than any previously produced, and was found to be the same with that of the Pelasgi, and not very different
        from the alphabet communicated to the Greeks by Cadmus. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dissertaz. dell Academia

The Cyprian Iliad had long been almost universally ascribed

against Epicurus, founded on the ambiguity of the word which has been translated
pleasure, but which would be more accurately interpreted happiness. A similar
outcry was, in later ages, raised by one of his opponents against Malebranche, who,

Some critics, however, are of opinion that he was called Doctus from the correctness
and purity of his Latin style. <span class="tei tei-q">“Latinæ puritatis custos fuit religiosissimus, unde et
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">docti</span></span> cognomen meruit.”</span> (Car. Stephen.) Müller, a German writer, has a notable
conjecture on this subject. He says, we will come nearest the truth, if we suppose
that Ovid, while mentioning Catullus, applied to him the epithet <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">doctus</span></span> merely to
fill up the measure of a line, and that his successors took up the appellation on trust.—(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Einleit.
zur Kenntniss der Lateinisch. Schriftsteller</span></span>, T. II. p. 265.) Mr
Elton thinks that the epithet did not mean what we understand by learned, but
rather knowing and accomplished—what the old English authors signify by cunning,
as cunning in music and the mathematics.—(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Specimens of the Classics</span></span>.) This
conjecture seems to be in some measure confirmed by Horace’s application of the
term <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">doctus</span></span> to the actor Roscius:—

The recent translator of Catullus conceives that the title of learned never belonged
peculiarly to him, but was merely conferred on him in common with all poets, as it
is now bestowed on all lawyers.</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_459" name="note_459" href="#noteref_459">459.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext"><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Catullus, in his miscellaneous poems, has employed not fewer than thirteen

army of Italy, visited in person this spot, which, during the life of Catullus, had been
his retreat and sanctuary, even from the despotism of Cæsar. While travelling from
Milan to Perseriano, to conclude the treaty of Campo Formio, he turned off from
the road, between Brescia and Peschiera, to visit the peninsula of Sirmio. About
two years afterwards, the French officers employed at the siege of Peschiera, which
is eight miles distant from Sirmio, gave a brilliant <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">fête champêtre</span></span> in this classic
retirement, in honour of Catullus, as soon as their military operations against Peschiera
had been brought to a successful conclusion. General St Michel, who had
conducted them, invited all the Polish officers who were present at the siege, and
some of the inhabitants of Sirmio—particularly the dramatic poet, Anelli. During
the repast, this bard, and the French generals, Lacombe and St Michel, sung and
recited in turn verses of their own composition; and which flowed spontaneously,
it is said by one who was present, from the inspiration of scenes so rich in poetic
remembrances. The toasts were—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Memory of Catullus</span></span>, the most elegant of
Latin poets—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Buonaparte</span></span>, who honours great men amid the tumult of arms—who
celebrated Virgil at Mantua, and paid homage to Catullus, by visiting the peninsula
of Sirmio—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">General Miollis</span></span>, the protector of sciences and fine arts in Italy. The
festivities were here unpleasantly interrupted by the arrival of all the uninvited inhabitants
of Sirmio, who came to complain of having been pillaged by the detachment
of French troops which had replaced the Austrian garrison. General Chasseloup
received them with his accustomed urbanity; and, from respect to Catullus, the
troops were marched from that canton to another district, which had not yet been
plundered, and had not the good fortune to have been the residence of a licentious
poet.—(Henin, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Jour. Historique des Operat.

8vo,) in opposition to all previous authority, has denied that this was the site of the
villa of Catullus, which he has removed to a spot due east from Tibur, between the
Acque Albule and Ponte Lucano. His opinion, however, is rested on the 26th
poem of Catullus, of which he has totally misunderstood the meaning,—
</p>
<div class="tei tei-lg" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em; margin-left: 2.00em; margin-top: 1.00em">

    <div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left"><span class="tei tei-q" style="text-align: left">“Furi, Villula nostra non ad Austri</span></div>
<div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left">Flatus opposita est, nec ad Favoni,</div>
<div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left">Nec sævi Boreæ, aut Apeliotæ;</div>
<div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left">Verum ad millia quindecim et ducentos—</div>
<div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left"><span class="tei tei-q" style="text-align: left">O ventum horribilem atque pestilentem.”</span></div>

</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Nibby strangely supposes that the fourth line of the above verses means that the
villa is 15 miles 200 paces from Rome, and, therefore, that it cannot be at St Angelo
in Piavola, the distance of which from Rome is not 15 miles 200 paces.—<span class="tei tei-q">“Questi
versi,”</span> says he, <span class="tei tei-q">“non solo non sono così decisìvi per situarla precisamente a St Angelo,
piu tosto che in altri luoghi di questi contorni; ma assolutamente la escludono,
poichè la stabaliscono quindìci miglia, e duecento passi vicino a Roma.”</span>—T. I. p.
166.
</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now, in the first place, according to Muretus and the best commentators, this ode
does not at all refer to the villa of Catullus, but of Furius, whom he addresses, since
the correct reading in the first line is not Villula <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">nostra</span></span>, but <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vostra</span></span>. Allowing,
however, that it should be <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">nostra</span></span>, it is quite impossible to extort from the fourth
line any proof that the villa was 15 miles 200 paces from Rome. Translated <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">verbatim</span></span>,
it is as follows:—<span class="tei tei-q">“Furius, our (your) villa is not exposed or liable to the blasts
of Auster or Favonius, or the sharp Boreas, or the Apeliot wind, but to fifteen thousand
and two hundred—O horrible and pestilent wind!”</span> Now, the question is, to
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">what</span></span> 15,000,200 is the villa exposed? (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">opposita</span></span>). Every commentator whom I
have consulted, supplies sesterces, or other pieces of money; that is to say, it was
mortgaged or pledged for that sum, which would sweep it away more effectually
than any wind. Nibby’s interpretation, that it is not exposed to Auster or Boreas,
&amp;c. but is 15 miles 200 paces distant from Rome, is not many miles, or even paces,
distant from absolute nonsense; and, moreover, quindecim millia, is not good Latin
for 15 miles.</p></dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_492" name="note_492" href="#noteref_492">492.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Observ.

the pulpitum, which was elevated on the stage about the height of a man, and
hence that the spectators saw only the gesticulating actor. If this plan was actually
adopted, the representation may have been conducted without any apparent incongruity
or violation of the scenic illusion. In Lord Gardenstoun’s <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Travelling
Memorandums</span></span>,”</span> we have an account of a play which he saw acted at Paris, where,
in order to elude a privilege, the actors who appeared on the stage did not speak
one word. <span class="tei tei-q">“Their lips,”</span> continued his lordship, <span class="tei tei-q">“move, and they go on with
corresponding action and attitudes. But every word of the play is uttered with
surprising propriety and character by persons behind the scenes. The play was
nearly over before this singularity was discovered to me and others of our party.
The whole was so strangely managed, that we could have sworn the visible actors
were also the speakers.”</span> (Vol. I. p. 24.) I have not, however, been able to discover
any ancient authority, from which it can be inferred that the representation of
a Roman play was conducted in this manner by the reciting actor being placed
either behind the scenes or pulpitum; and all authorities concur as to this strange
division of dramatic labour, at least in the monologues of tragedies.</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_621" name="note_621" href="#noteref_621">621.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext">Cicero, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Paradox.</span></span> III. c. 2.</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_622" name="note_622" href="#noteref_622">622.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Epist.</span></span> 121.</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_623" name="note_623" href="#noteref_623">623.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Inst.

It may mean that these old men, having been accustomed to the natural
countenance, did not applaud even so great an actor as Roscius, because he was
invariably masked: or it may signify, that they did not greatly admire him when
masked, and only applauded him when he appeared in his natural aspect. As some
authorities say that Roscius <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">invariably</span></span> used the mask, the former interpretation
may, perhaps, appear the most probable.</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_639" name="note_639" href="#noteref_639">639.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Institut.

            in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including
            obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the
            efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks
            of life.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
            assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™'s goals and
            ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will remain freely available for
            generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a
            secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future generations. To learn

            of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in
            machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment
            including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are
            particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the
            IRS.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
            charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
            States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
            considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
            with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where
            we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
            DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state

            any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from

            support.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of
            which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright

            compliance with any particular paper edition.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
